                 electrocardiograms for clinical decision making is that
                 the waveforms are influenced by normal physiological
                 and technical factors as well as by pathophysiological
                 factors. Traditionally, the focus of bedside monitoring
                 is detection of arrhythmia. However, continuous
                 ST-segment monitoring for the detection of myocardial
                 ischemia is now readily available. Many factors affect
                 electrocardiographic waveforms and may interfere with
                 diagnosis of myocardial ischemia based on
                 electrocardiographic findings. Accordingly, a principal
                 leadership role for clinical nurse specialists and
                 nurse practitioners is to become knowledgeable about
                 interpretation of 12-lead electrocardiograms and to
                 share this knowledge with staff nurses who care for
                 patients with acute coronary syndromes. The factors
                 that alter electrocardiographic findings are reviewed,
                 and the alterations that interfere with
                 electrocardiogram-based diagnosis of myocardial
                 ischemia are discussed.",

                 and right ventricles has been developed to study the
                 process of myocardial electrical activation. The
                 experimentally measured velocity is known to depend on
                 membrane processes, the cellular shape, fiber
                 orientation, and the interaction with neighboring
                 cells. The simulated process is, therefore, governed by
                 the geometry and by the directional conduction velocity
                 at each point in the myocardial volume. The geometry of
                 the ventricles is described by ellipsoidal shape, and
                 divided to layers and sections, each filled with cells
                 of preassigned properties. It allows for taking into
                 account the local orientation of the myocardial fibers
                 and their distributed velocities and refractory
                 periods. The values are Gaussly distributed around the
                 mean, and the mean and variance differ at each section.
                 A conduction network of Purkinje cells is included on
                 the endocardial surface. The anisotropic properties are
                 demonstrated during simulation of an abnormal cardiac
                 cycle, when propagating is initiated at an ectopic
                 ventricular site. Ischemia is simulated by low
                 conduction velocities in the ischemic zone and wide
                 dispersion of values in nearby locations; automaticity
                 is described by restimulating cells in the injured
                 area; the dangerous effects of a premature beat leading
                 to reentry are simulated by reduction of propagation
                 velocity in cells that are reactivated while they
                 repolarize. The different activation patterns are
                 calculated throughout the myocardium and on its
                 surface. The generated surface activation maps are not
                 sensitive to minute changes in location of the foci of
                 activation within the normal conduction system. The
                 maps show sensitivity to pathological velocities,
                 ischemic areas, and the existence of ectopic
                 foci.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

                 electrocardiographic (ECG) electrodes when a patient
                 turns to one side has been reported to cause ST-segment
                 shifts, triggering false alarms with continuous
                 ST-segment monitoring. We prospectively analyzed
                 ST-segment and QRS complex changes in both standard and
                 derived ECGs in 40 subjects (18 with heart disease and
                 22 healthy) in supine, right- and left-lying positions.
                 Of the 40 subjects, 6 (4 cardiac, 2 healthy) developed
                 positional ST deviations of 1 mm or more on the
                 standard ECG. In the derived method, five of the same
                 six subjects showed ST-segment deviation of which most
                 occurred in the left-lying position. Positional ST
                 changes were most frequent for males and for cardiac
                 patients (33\%). Changes in QRS complex morphology were
                 common on the standard (28 of 40, 70\%) and less
                 frequent on the derived ECGs (17 of 40, 43\%),
                 occurring in both healthy and cardiac subjects. QRS
                 axis changes occurred only on the standard ECG. It was
                 concluded that (1) right and left side-lying positions
                 frequently induce clinically significant ECG changes;
                 (2) positional ST-segment deviation is less frequent
                 than previously reported and is most likely to occur in
                 males with cardiac disease; and (3) the derived method
                 is less prone to positional QRS changes than the

                 fibrillation (AF) is related to cardiovascular
                 comorbidities. We studied the relationship between left
                 ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) and left atrial tissue
                 structural remodelling (LA-SRM), in patients presenting
                 for AF ablation. METHODS AND RESULTS: We identified 404 AF
                 patients who received a late gadolinium enhancement
                 magnetic resonance imaging (LGE-MRI) prior to catheter
                 ablation. Left ventricular hypertrophy was defined as LV
                 mass index >116 g/m(2) in men and >104 g/m(2) in women.
                 One hundred and twenty-two patients were classified as the
                 LVH group and 282 as the non-LVH group. We stratified
                 patients into four stages based on their degree of LA-SRM
                 (minimal, <5\% fibrosis; mild, >5-20\%; moderate,
                 >20-35\%; and extensive, >35\%). All patients underwent
                 catheter ablation with pulmonary vein isolation and
                 posterior wall and septal debulking. The procedural
                 outcome was monitored over a 1-year follow-up period. The
                 mean LA-SRM was significantly higher in patients with LVH
                 (19.4 +/- 13.2\%) than in non-LVH patients (15.3 +/-
                 9.8\%; P< 0.01). Patients with LVH generally had extensive
                 LA-SRM (moderate and extensive stages; 38.5\% of LVH
                 group) as compared with non-LVH patients (23.1\% of
                 non-LVH group; P < 0.01). A Cox regression analysis showed
                 that patients with LVH also had significantly higher AF
                 recurrence rates than non-LVH patients (43.2 vs. 28\%; P =
                 0.008) during the 1-year follow-up period post-ablation.
                 CONCLUSION: Patients with LVH tend to have a significantly
                 greater degree of LA-SRM, when compared with patients
                 without LVH. Moreover, LA-SRM is a predictor for
                 procedural success in patients undergoing AF ablation

                 left ventricular (LV) function in patients with atrial
                 fibrillation (AF) and LV systolic dysfunction. In this
                 study, we compared the degree of left atrial structural
                 remodeling (LA-SRM) in patients with normal versus reduced
                 LV ejection fraction (LVEF). We also studied the impact of
                 LA-SRM on LVEF improvement in patients undergoing ablation
                 of AF. METHOD AND RESULTS: We categorized 384 patients
                 into 2 groups based on their cardiac function: reduced
                 LVEF group (LVEF </=50\%; n = 105) and normal LVEF group
                 (LVEF > 50\%; n = 279). LVEF was determined prior and mean
                 8 +/- 3 months after catheter ablation for AF. Percentage
                 of LA-SRM was quantified using LGE-MRI and patients were
                 classified into 4 groups based on the amount of structural
                 remodeling in their LA wall: minimal </= 5\%, mild =
                 5-20\%, moderate = 20-35\%, and extensive >/= 35\%. The
                 average preablation LA-SRM (21.5 +/- 13.2\% vs 15.4 +/-
                 10.0\%; P < 0.001) was significantly higher in reduced
                 LVEF group than normal LVEF group. Among the 105 patients
                 with reduced LVEF, while there was a modest 11.7 +/- 8.4\%
                 average increase in LVEF following ablation, the greatest
                 increase was seen in patients with less extensive LA-SRM
                 (minimal = 19.3 +/- 5.1\%, n = 3, P = 0.02 and mild = 16.6
                 +/- 9.9\%, n = 48, P < 0.001). Patients with moderate and
                 extensive fibrosis had an average EF improvement of 8.7
                 +/- 11.1\% and 2.8 +/- 6.4\%, respectively (n = 39, P <
                 0.001 and n = 15, P = 0.11, respectively). CONCLUSION:
                 Patients with LV systolic dysfunction displayed a
                 comparatively greater LA-SRM than patients with normal
                 LVEF. Patients with lesser LA-SRM experienced a greater
                 improvement in LVEF after catheter ablation for AF.",

                  hundred forty-four patients with atrial fibrillation (AF)
                  presenting for catheter ablation underwent LGE-MRI. Left
                  atrial (LA) fibrosis was quantified in all patients and right
                  atrial (RA) fibrosis in 134 patients. All patients underwent
                  catheter ablation with pulmonary vein isolation with
                  posterior wall and septal debulking. Patients were followed
                  prospectively for 329 +/- 245 days. Ambulatory monitoring was
                  instituted every 3 months. Symptomatic pauses and bradycardia
                  were treated with pacemaker implantation per published
                  guidelines. RESULTS: The average wall fibrosis was 16.7 +/-
                  11.1\% in the LA, and 5.3 +/- 6.4\% in the RA. RA fibrosis
                  was correlated with LA fibrosis (R(2) = 0.26; P <
                  0.01). Patients were divided into 4 stages of LA fibrosis
                  (Utah I: <5\%, Utah II: 5-20\%, Utah III: 20-35\%, Utah IV:
                  >35\%). Twenty-two patients (mean atrial fibrosis, 23.9\%)
                  required pacemaker implantation during follow-up. Univariate
                  and multivariate analysis identified LA fibrosis stage (OR,
                  2.2) as a significant predictor for pacemaker implantation
                  with an area under the curve of 0.704. CONCLUSIONS: In
                  patients with AF presenting for catheter ablation, LGE-MRI
                  quantification of atrial fibrosis demonstrates preferential
                  LA involvement. Significant atrial fibrosis is associated

                 used to evaluate for left atrial appendage (LAA) thrombi
                 prior to restoration of sinus rhythm in atrial
                 fibrillation (AF). We examined the relationship of atrial
                 fibrosis quantified using late gadolinium enhancement MRI
                 (LGE-MRI) with TEE findings. METHODS AND RESULTS: We
                 included 178 patients with AF, undergoing TEE and LGE-MRI
                 prior to ablation or cardioversion. LGE-MRI and subsequent
                 image processing was used to quantify atrial fibrosis
                 based on signal intensity analysis. The mean CHADS2 score
                 was 1.24 +/- 1.08 and CHA2 DS2 -VASc was 2.08 +/- 1.33.
                 The LAA was classified as normal, spontaneous
                 echocardiographic contrast (SEC) present or thrombus
                 present. LAA thrombus was found in 12 patients (6.7\%)
                 while SEC was identified in 19 patients (10.7\%). Patients
                 with thrombus had higher atrial fibrosis compared to
                 patients without thrombus (26.9 +/- 17.4\% vs 16.7 +/-
                 10.5\%; P < 0.01). Atrial fibrosis was also higher in
                 patients with SEC (23.3 +/- 13.7\%) compared to those
                 without SEC (16.7 +/- 10.8\%; P = 0.01). Patients with
                 high atrial fibrosis (>20\%) were more likely to have a
                 LAA thrombus (odds ratio 4.6; P = 0.02) and SEC (odds
                 ratio 2.6; P = 0.06). Multivariate logistic regression
                 showed high fibrosis (odds ratio 3.6; P < 0.01) and CHADS2
                 >/=2 (odds ratio 3.5; P < 0.01) were significant
                 predictors of TEE abnormalities (LAA thrombus or SEC). The
                 area under the curve for the model including high
                 fibrosis, AF type and CHADS2 >/=2 or CHA2 DS2 -VASc >/=2
                 was 0.73 compared to 0.63 and 0.65 for CHADS2 and CHA2 DS2
                 -VASc alone. CONCLUSIONS: Atrial fibrosis is independently
                 associated with appendage thrombus and spontaneous
                 contrast. It provides additional risk stratification not
                 captured by clinical parameters.",

                 encirclement and substrate modification in predicting
                 outcome of catheter ablation in AF. METHODS AND RESULTS:
                 LGE-MRI was performed to quantify baseline atrial
                 fibrosis, which was classified into four stages (stage I
                 with fibrosis <10\%, stage II with fibrosis 10-20\%, stage
                 III with fibrosis 20-30\%, and stage IV with fibrosis
                 >/=30\%). Patients then underwent ablation and repeat
                 LGE-MRI at three months to assess for ablation-induced
                 scarring. PVs were studied to evaluate for complete
                 encirclement with scar. Image processing was used to
                 overlay the scar onto baseline fibrosis to assess the
                 overlap and calculate residual fibrosis. A total of 172
                 patients were included with an average baseline fibrosis
                 of 14.6 +/- 8.4\%. The average number of PVs encircled
                 with scar at three months was 1.2 +/- 1.3 with only 9\% of
                 patients having all four PVs completely encircled. The
                 average residual fibrosis was 11.9 +/- 7.3\%. High
                 residual fibrosis was defined as >10\%. Recurrent AF was
                 found in 60 patients (34.9\%) over a follow-up of 346 +/-
                 82 days. Baseline and high residual fibrosis were
                 significant predictors of recurrence (hazard ratio [HR] of
                 2.2; P < 0.01 and HR of 3.2; P < 0.01, respectively). The
                 number of PV encircled was not a significant predictor of
                 recurrence. CONCLUSION: LGE-MRI of ablation-induced
                 scarring demonstrates that chronic PV encirclement is
                 rarely achieved. Procedural outcomes are better predicted
                 by baseline atrial fibrosis and ablation-induced substrate

                 fibrillation (AF) often transition between sinus rhythm
                 and AF. For AF to initiate there must be both a trigger
                 and a substrate that facilitates reentrant activity. This
                 trigger is often caused by a premature atrial contraction
                 or focal activations within the atrium. We hypothesize
                 that specific architectures of fibrosis alter local
                 conduction to enable AF. METHODS AND RESULTS: Control
                 goats (n = 13) and goats in chronic AF (for an average of
                 6 months, n = 6) had a high-density electrode plaque
                 placed on the LA appendage. Conduction patterns following
                 a premature atrial contraction, caused by an electrical
                 stimulation, were quantified to determine regions of
                 conduction slowing. These regions were compared to
                 architecture, either diffuse fibrosis or regions of
                 obstructive fibrosis, and overall fibrosis levels as
                 determined by histology from the mapped region. The
                 chronic AF goats had more obstructive fibrosis than the
                 controls (17.5 +/- 8.0 fibers/mm(2) vs. 8.6 +/- 3.0
                 fibers/mm(2)). Conduction velocity of the AF goats was
                 significantly slowed compared to the control goats in the
                 transverse direction (0.40 +/- 0.04 m/s vs. 0.53 +/- 0.15
                 m/s) but not in the longitudinal direction (0.70 +/- 0.27
                 m/s vs. 0.76 +/- 0.18 m/s). CONCLUSIONS: AF-induced atrial
                 remodeling leads to increased obstructive fibrosis and
                 conduction velocity slowing transverse to fiber
                 orientation following premature stimuli. The decrease in
                 conduction velocity causes a decrease in the cardiac
                 wavelength, and increases the likelihood of reentry and AF
                 onset.",

                 measurements from the intramyocardial space contain more
                 sensitive markers of ischemia than those detectable on the
                 epicardium. The goal of this study was to evaluate
                 different electrical markers for their potential to detect
                 the earliest phases of acute myocardial ischemia. METHODS:
                 We conducted acute ischemia studies in open chest animal,
                 by creating finely controlled demand or supply ischemic
                 episodes and recording intramyocardial and epicardial
                 potentials. RESULTS: Under the conditions of mild
                 perfusion deficit, acute ischemia induced changes in the T
                 wave that were larger and could be detected earlier on the
                 epicardial surface than ST-segment changes. CONCLUSIONS:
                 Our findings indicate that in the setting of very acute
                 ischemia, epicardial T waves have higher sensitivity to
                 mild degrees of acute ischemia than epicardial ST
                 potentials. These results suggest that changes in the T
                 wave shape may augment shifts in ST segments to improve

                 mediastinal nerves, as well as the response of such
                 arrhythmias to autonomic modulation. Under general
                 anaesthesia, atrioventricular block was induced after
                 thoracotomy in 19 canines. Brief trains of 5 electrical
                 stimuli were delivered to right-sided mediastinal
                 nerves during the atrial refractory period. Unipolar
                 electrograms were recorded from 191 right and left
                 atrial epicardial sites under several conditions, i.e.
                 (i) with intact nervous systems and following (ii)
                 acute decentralization of the intrathoracic nervous
                 system or administration of (iii) atropine, (iv)
                 timolol, (v) hexamethonium. Concomitant right atrial
                 endocardial mapping was performed in 7 of these dogs.
                 Mediastinal nerve stimulation consistently initiated
                 bradycardia followed by atrial tachyarrhythmias. In the
                 initial tachyarrhythmia beats, early epicardial
                 breakthroughs were identified in the right atrial free
                 wall (28/50 episodes) or Bachmann bundle region
                 (22/50), which corresponded to endocardial sites of
                 origin associated with the right atrial subsidiary
                 pacemaker complex, i.e. the crista terminalis and
                 dorsal locations including the right atrial aspect of
                 the interatrial septum. Neuronally induced responses
                 were eliminated by atropine, modified by timolol and
                 unaffected by acute neuronal decentralization. After
                 hexamethonium, responses to extra-pericardial but not
                 intra-pericardial nerve stimulation were eliminated. It
                 is concluded that concomitant activation of cholinergic
                 and adrenergic efferent intrinsic cardiac neurons
                 induced by right-sided efferent neuronal stimulation
                 initiates atrial tachyarrhythmias that originate from
                 foci anatomically related to the right atrial pacemaker

                 resonance imaging with late gadolinium enhancement (LGE)
                 may identify slowly conducting tissues in scar-related
                 ventricular tachycardia (VT). OBJECTIVE: To test the
                 feasibility of image-based simulation based on LGE to
                 estimate ablation targets in VT. METHODS: We conducted a
                 retrospective study in 13 patients who had preablation
                 magnetic resonance imaging for scar-related VT ablation.
                 We used image-based simulation to induce VT and estimate
                 target regions according to the simulated VT circuit. The
                 estimated target regions were coregistered with the LGE
                 scar map and the ablation sites from the electroanatomical
                 map in the standard ablation approach. RESULTS: In
                 image-based simulation, VT was inducible in 12 (92.3\%)
                 patients. All VTs showed macroreentrant propagation
                 patterns, and the narrowest width of estimated target
                 region that an ablation line should span to prevent VT
                 recurrence was 5.0 +/- 3.4 mm. Of 11 patients who
                 underwent ablation, the results of image-based simulation
                 and the standard approach were consistent in 9 (82\%)
                 patients, where ablation within the estimated target
                 region was associated with acute success (n = 8) and
                 ablation outside the estimated target region was
                 associated with failure (n = 1). In 1 (9\%) case, the
                 results of image-based simulation and the standard
                 approach were inconsistent, where ablation outside the
                 estimated target region was associated with acute success.
                 CONCLUSIONS: The image-based simulation can be used to
                 estimate potential ablation targets of scar-related VT.
                 The image-based simulation may be a powerful noninvasive
                 tool for preprocedural planning of ablation procedures to
                 potentially reduce the procedure time and complication

                 insufficient resection of bone during the index
                 femoroplasty is the most-common reason for revision
                 surgery in patients with cam-type femoroacetabular
                 impingement (FAI). Development of surgical resection
                 guidelines therefore could reduce the number of patients
                 with persistent pain and reduced ROM after femoroplasty.
                 QUESTIONS/PURPOSES: We asked whether removal of
                 subchondral cortical bone in the region of the lesion in
                 patients with cam FAI could restore femoral anatomy to
                 that of screened control subjects. To evaluate this, we
                 analyzed shape models between: (1) native cam and screened
                 control femurs to observe the location of the cam lesion
                 and establish baseline shape differences between groups,
                 and (2) cam femurs with simulated resections and screened
                 control femurs to evaluate the sufficiency of subchondral
                 cortical bone thickness to guide resection depth. METHODS:
                 Three-dimensional (3-D) reconstructions of the inner and
                 outer cortical bone boundaries of the proximal femur were
                 generated by segmenting CT images from 45 control subjects
                 (29 males; 15 living subjects, 30 cadavers) with normal
                 radiographic findings and 28 nonconsecutive patients (26
                 males) with a diagnosis of cam FAI based on radiographic
                 measurements and clinical examinations. Correspondence
                 particles were placed on each femur and statistical shape
                 modeling (SSM) was used to create mean shapes for each
                 cohort. The geometric difference between the mean shape of
                 the patients with cam FAI and that of the screened
                 controls was used to define a consistent region
                 representing the cam lesion. Subchondral cortical bone in
                 this region was removed from the 3-D reconstructions of
                 each cam femur to create a simulated resection. SSM was
                 repeated to determine if the resection produced femoral
                 anatomy that better resembled that of control subjects.
                 Correspondence particle locations were used to generate
                 mean femur shapes and evaluate shape differences using
                 principal component analysis. RESULTS: In the region of
                 the cam lesion, the median distance between the mean
                 native cam and control femurs was 1.8 mm (range, 1.0-2.7
                 mm). This difference was reduced to 0.2 mm (range, -0.2 to
                 0.9 mm) after resection, with some areas of overresection
                 anteriorly and underresection superiorly. In the region of
                 resection for each subject, the distance from each
                 correspondence particle to the mean control shape was
                 greater for the cam femurs than the screened control
                 femurs (1.8 mm, [range, 1.1-2.9 mm] and 0.0 mm [range,
                 -0.2-0.1 mm], respectively; p < 0.031). After resection,
                 the distance was not different between the resected cam
                 and control femurs (0.3 mm; range, -0.2-1.0; p > 0.473).
                 CONCLUSIONS: Removal of subchondral cortical bone in the
                 region of resection reduced the deviation between the mean
                 resected cam and control femurs to within a millimeter,
                 which resulted in no difference in shape between patients
                 with cam FAI and control subjects. Collectively, our
                 results support the use of the subchondral
                 cortical-cancellous bone margin as a visual intraoperative
                 guide to limit resection depth in the correction of cam
                 FAI. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Use of the subchondral
                 cortical-cancellous bone boundary may provide a method to
                 guide the depth of resection during arthroscopic surgery,
                 which can be observed intraoperatively without advanced
                 tooling, or imaging.",

                 may elicit bone remodeling at the proximal femur, causing
                 increases in cortical bone thickness. We used
                 correspondence-based shape modeling to quantify and
                 compare cortical thickness between cam patients and
                 controls for the location of the cam lesion and the
                 proximal femur. Computed tomography images were segmented
                 for 45 controls and 28 cam-type FAI patients. The
                 segmentations were input to a correspondence-based shape
                 model to identify the region of the cam lesion. Median
                 cortical thickness data over the region of the cam lesion
                 and the proximal femur were compared between mixed-gender
                 and gender-specific groups. Median [interquartile range]
                 thickness was significantly greater in FAI patients than
                 controls in the cam lesion (1.47 [0.64] vs. 1.13 [0.22]
                 mm, respectively; p < 0.001) and proximal femur (1.28
                 [0.30] vs. 0.97 [0.22] mm, respectively; p < 0.001).
                 Maximum thickness in the region of the cam lesion was more
                 anterior and less lateral (p < 0.001) in FAI patients.
                 Male FAI patients had increased thickness compared to male
                 controls in the cam lesion (1.47 [0.72] vs. 1.10 [0.19]
                 mm, respectively; p < 0.001) and proximal femur (1.25
                 [0.29] vs. 0.94 [0.17] mm, respectively; p < 0.001).
                 Thickness was not significantly different between male and
                 female controls. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: Studies of
                 non-pathologic cadavers have provided guidelines regarding
                 safe surgical resection depth for FAI patients. However,
                 our results suggest impingement induces cortical
                 thickening in cam patients, which may strengthen the
                 proximal femur. Thus, these previously established
                 guidelines may be too conservative. (c) 2016 Orthopaedic

                 demand fast matrix solvers for both the elliptic and

                 known that fast matrix solvers for the elliptic part
                 must address multiple physical scales in order to show
                 robust behavior. Recent research on finding the proper
                 solution method for the bidomain equations has
                 addressed this issue whereby multigrid preconditioned
                 conjugate gradients has been used as a solver. In this
                 paper, a more robust multigrid method, called Black Box
                 Multigrid, is presented as an alternative to
                 conventional geometric multigrid, and the effect of
                 discontinuities on solver performance for the elliptic
                 and parabolic part is investigated. Test problems with
                 discontinuities arising from inserted plunge electrodes
                 and naturally occurring myocardial discontinuities are
                 considered. For these problems, we explore the

                 like Black Box Multigrid over conventional geometric
                 multigrid. Results will indicate that for certain
                 discontinuous bidomain problems Black Box Multigrid
                 provides 60\% faster simulations than using
                 conventional geometric multigrid. Also, for the
                 problems examined, it will be shown that a direct usage
                 of conventional multigrid leads to faster simulations
                 than an indirect usage of conventional multigrid as a

                 epilepsy diagnosis, we introduce here a new experimental
                 and methodological source analysis pipeline that combines
                 the complementary information in EEG and MEG, and apply it
                 to data from a patient, suffering from refractory focal
                 epilepsy. Skull conductivity parameters in a six
                 compartment finite element head model with brain
                 anisotropy, constructed from individual MRI data, are
                 estimated in a calibration procedure using somatosensory
                 evoked potential (SEP) and field (SEF) data. These data
                 are measured in a single run before acquisition of further
                 runs of spontaneous epileptic activity. Our results show
                 that even for single interictal spikes, volume conduction
                 effects dominate over noise and need to be taken into
                 account for accurate source analysis. While cerebrospinal
                 fluid and brain anisotropy influence both modalities, only
                 EEG is sensitive to skull conductivity and conductivity
                 calibration significantly reduces the difference in
                 especially depth localization of both modalities,
                 emphasizing its importance for combining EEG and MEG
                 source analysis. On the other hand, localization
                 differences which are due to the distinct sensitivity
                 profiles of EEG and MEG persist. In case of a moderate
                 error in skull conductivity, combined source analysis
                 results can still profit from the different sensitivity
                 profiles of EEG and MEG to accurately determine location,
                 orientation and strength of the underlying sources. On the
                 other side, significant errors in skull modeling are
                 reflected in EEG reconstruction errors and could reduce
                 the goodness of fit to combined datasets. For combined EEG
                 and MEG source analysis, we therefore recommend
                 calibrating skull conductivity using additionally acquired

                 study was to describe DE-MRI findings of the LA in the
                 acute and chronic stages postablation. METHODS:
                 Twenty-five patients were scanned at two time points
                 postablation. The first group (n = 10) underwent DE-MRI at
                 24 hours and at 3 months. The second group (n = 16) was
                 scanned at 3 months and at 6 or 9 months. One patient had
                 three scans (24 hours, 3 months, 9 months) and was
                 included in both groups. The location and extent of
                 enhancement were then analyzed between both groups.
                 RESULTS: The median change in LA wall injury between 24
                 hours and 3 months was -6.38\% (range -11.7\% to 12.58\%).
                 The median change in LA wall injury between 3 months and
                 later follow-up was +2.0\% (range -4.0\% to 6.58\%). There
                 appears to be little relationship between the enhancement
                 at 24 hours and 3 months (R(2) = 0.004). In contrast, a
                 strong correlation is seen at 3 months and later follow-up
                 (R(2) = 0.966). Qualitative comparison revealed a stronger
                 qualitative relationship between MRI findings at 3 months
                 and later follow-up than at 24 hours and 3 months.
                 CONCLUSION: RF-induced scar appears to have formed by 3
                 months postablation. At 24 hours postablation, DE-MRI
                 enhancement appears consistent with a transient
                 inflammatory response rather than stable LA scar
                 formation.",

                 viable therapeutic option for those patients who have
                 failed conventional medical therapy. This treatment
                 strategy has been introduced in the past decade following
                 the discovery of ectopic foci in the pulmonary veins
                 capable of initiating this arrhythmia. The basis of
                 current ablation techniques relies on inducing myocardial
                 necrosis at distinct anatomical landmarks in order to
                 electrically isolate these ectopic foci and to disrupt
                 pulmonary vein and left atrial conduction pathways. The
                 recent introduction of a delayed-enhancement cardiac MRI
                 sequence now allows for the noninvasive assessment of the
                 location and extent of left atrial scarring following the
                 ablation procedure. In this review, we describe this novel
                 scan sequence and its current and potential role in
                 catheter ablation of atrial fibrillation.",

                 the automatic phenotyping of mouse embryos, wherein
                 multiple embryos embedded within a single tube were
                 scanned using Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI). RESULTS:
                 Our algorithm, a modified version of the simplex
                 deformable model of Delingette, addresses various issues
                 with deformable models including initialization and
                 inability to adapt to boundary concavities. In addition,
                 it proposes a novel technique for automatic collision
                 detection of multiple objects which are being segmented
                 simultaneously, hence avoiding major leaks into adjacent
                 neighbouring structures. We address the initialization
                 problem by introducing balloon forces which expand the
                 initial spherical models close to the true boundaries of
                 the embryos. This results in models which are less
                 sensitive to initial minimum of two fold after each stage
                 of deformation. To determine collision during
                 segmentation, our unique collision detection algorithm
                 finds the intersection between binary masks created from
                 the deformed models after every few iterations of the
                 deformation and modifies the segmentation parameters
                 accordingly hence avoiding collision.We have segmented six
                 tubes of three dimensional MR images of multiple mouse
                 embryos using our modified deformable model algorithm. We
                 have then validated the results of the our semi-automatic
                 segmentation versus manual segmentation of the same
                 embryos. Our Validation shows that except paws and tails
                 we have been able to segment the mouse embryos with minor
                 error. CONCLUSIONS: This paper describes our novel
                 multiple object segmentation technique with collision
                 detection using a modified deformable model algorithm.
                 Further, it presents the results of segmenting magnetic
                 resonance images of up to 32 mouse embryos stacked in one
                 gel filled test tube and creating 32 individual masks.

                 elicit muscle contractions responsible for pumping blood
                 throughout the body. The shape and direction of these
                 waves depend on the spatial arrangement of ventricular
                 myocytes, termed fiber orientation. In computational
                 studies simulating electrical wave propagation or
                 mechanical contraction in the heart, accurately
                 representing fiber orientation is critical so that model
                 predictions corroborate with experimental data. Typically,
                 fiber orientation is assigned to heart models based on
                 Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI) data, yet few alternative
                 methodologies exist if DTI data is noisy or absent. Here
                 we present a novel Laplace-Dirichlet Rule-Based (LDRB)
                 algorithm to perform this task with speed, precision, and
                 high usability. We demonstrate the application of the LDRB
                 algorithm in an image-based computational model of the
                 canine ventricles. Simulations of electrical activation in
                 this model are compared to those in the same geometrical
                 model but with DTI-derived fiber orientation. The results
                 demonstrate that activation patterns from simulations with
                 LDRB and DTI-derived fiber orientations are nearly
                 indistinguishable, with relative differences </=6\%,
                 absolute mean differences in activation times </=3.15 ms,
                 and positive correlations >/=0.99. These results
                 convincingly show that the LDRB algorithm is a robust
                 alternative to DTI for assigning fiber orientation to
                 computational heart models.",

                 electrocardiogram (ECG) has revolutionized the way

                 the cornerstone of modern medicine today. Driven by
                 clinical and research needs for a more precise
                 understanding of cardiac electrophysiology beyond
                 traditional ECG, inverse solution electrocardiography has
                 been developed, tested, and validated. This article
                 outlines the important progress from ECG development,
                 through more extensive measurement of body surface
                 potentials, and the fundamental leap to solving the

                 surface potentials defines the forward problem of
                 electrocardiography. A robust formulation of the forward
                 problem is instrumental to solving the inverse problem, in
                 which epicardial potentials are computed from known body
                 surface potentials. Here, the accuracy of different
                 forward models has been evaluated experimentally. METHODS
                 AND RESULTS: Body surface and epicardial potentials were
                 recorded simultaneously in anesthetized closed-chest pigs
                 (n=5) during sinus rhythm, and epicardial and endocardial
                 ventricular pacing (65 records in total). Body surface
                 potentials were simulated from epicardial recordings using
                 experiment-specific volume conductor models constructed
                 from magnetic resonance imaging. Results for homogeneous
                 (isotropic electric properties) and inhomogeneous
                 (incorporating lungs, anisotropic skeletal muscle, and
                 subcutaneous fat) forward models were compared with
                 measured body surface potentials. Correlation coefficients
                 were 0.85+/-0.08 across all animals and activation
                 sequences with no significant difference between
                 homogeneous and inhomogeneous solutions (P=0.85). Despite
                 this, there was considerable variance between simulated
                 and measured body surface potential distributions.
                 Differences between the body surface potential extrema
                 predicted with homogeneous forward models were 55\% to
                 78\% greater than observed (P<0.05) and attenuation of
                 potentials adjacent to extrema were 10\% to 171\% greater
                 (P<0.03). The length and orientation of the vector between
                 potential extrema were also significantly different.
                 Inclusion of inhomogeneous electric properties in the
                 forward model reduced, but did not eliminate these
                 differences. CONCLUSIONS: These results demonstrate that
                 homogeneous volume conductor models introduce substantial
                 spatial inaccuracies in forward problem solutions. This
                 probably affects the precision of inverse reconstructions
                 of cardiac potentials, in which this assumption is made.",

                 cohort, free of a history of atrial fibrillation,
                 between the ages of 55 and 94 years. MAIN OUTCOME
                 MEASURES--Sex-specific multiple logistic regression
                 models to identify independent risk factors for atrial
                 fibrillation, including age, smoking, diabetes,
                 electrocardiographic left ventricular hypertrophy,
                 hypertension, myocardial infarction, congestive heart
                 failure, and valve disease. RESULTS--During up to 38
                 years of follow-up, 264 men and 298 women developed
                 atrial fibrillation. After adjusting for age and other
                 risk factors for atrial fibrillation, men had a 1.5
                 times greater risk of developing atrial fibrillation
                 than women. In the full multivariable model, the odds
                 ratio (OR) of atrial fibrillation for each decade of
                 advancing age was 2.1 for men and 2.2 for women (P
                 <.0001). CONCLUSION--In addition to intrinsic cardiac
                 causes such as valve disease and congestive heart
                 failure, risk factors for cardiovascular disease also
                 predispose to atrial fibrillation. Modification of risk
                 factors for cardiovascular disease may have the added

                 to 94 years of age who developed AF during 40 years of
                 follow-up of the original Framingham Heart Study
                 cohort. Of the original 5209 subjects, 296 men and 325
                 women (mean ages, 74 and 76 years, respectively)
                 developed AF and met eligibility criteria. AF was
                 associated with an OR for death of 1.5 (95\% CI, 1.2 to
                 1.8) in men and 1.9 (95\% CI, 1.5 to 2.2) in women. In
                 secondary multivariate analyses, in subjects free of
                 valvular heart disease and preexisting cardiovascular
                 disease, AF remained significantly associated with
                 excess mortality, with about a doubling of mortality in
                 both sexes. CONCLUSIONS: In subjects from the original
                 cohort of the Framingham Heart Study, AF was associated
                 with a 1.5- to 1.9-fold mortality risk after adjustment

                 ventricular myocytes is the major source of Ca which
                 activates cardiac contraction (although Ca influx makes
                 a non-negligible contribution in most species). The
                 fundamental events of SR Ca release are known as Ca
                 sparks. The twitch Ca transient is composed of
                 approximately 10,000 Ca sparks occurring in a given
                 cell, and they are synchronized by the action potential
                 and Ca current. Many factors influence SR Ca release
                 amplitude and kinetics, and the focus here is on
                 understanding how these factors work in the intact
                 cellular environment. The intracellular [Ca] ([Ca]i)
                 and intra-SR [Ca] ([Ca]SR) are two of the most
                 important dynamic modulators of SR Ca release. Indeed,
                 while [Ca]i (and Ca current which initiates systolic SR
                 Ca release) is widely acknowledged to be important, it
                 is increasingly clear that [Ca]SR changes dynamically
                 under physiological conditions and that this has very
                 important regulatory effects on the SR Ca release
                 process. While elevation of [Ca]SR obviously increases
                 the driving force and amount of SR Ca available for
                 release, it also increases the fractional release and
                 can be responsible for spontaneous diastolic SR Ca
                 release. These issues are discussed in both normal
                 physiological and pathophysiological contexts. No hard

                 technique in isolated rat and guinea pig ventricular
                 myocytes. Three distinct K+ channels were examined: the
                 inward rectifier (IK1), the delayed rectifier (IK), and
                 the transient outward (I(to)) currents. Both astemizole
                 and terfenadine suppressed the IK1 channel by 17\% to
                 50\% in a voltage-dependent manner. Ito was evaluated
                 in rat ventricular myocytes. Both drugs also inhibited
                 the maintained component of I(to) to a lesser extent,
                 by 23\%, in a dose-dependent, reversible manner. IK was

                 not astemizole slightly inhibited IK, by 9\%, and only

                 generates a realistic ECG waveform that scales the

                 diffusion coefficient ranges between 0.055 mm2/msec to
                 1 mm2/msec. The propagation velocity of the myocardial

                 important role in defining the orientation of the
                 patellofemoral joint, influencing contact areas,
                 pressures, and cartilage stress distributions. The purpose
                 of this study was to determine the influence of femoral
                 internal and external rotation on stresses in the
                 patellofemoral cartilage. We constructed finite element
                 models of the patellofemoral joint using magnetic
                 resonance (MR) images from 16 volunteers (8 male and 8
                 female). Subjects performed an upright weight-bearing
                 squat with the knee at 60 degrees of flexion inside an
                 open-MR scanner and in a gait laboratory. Quadriceps
                 muscle forces were estimated for each subject using an
                 electromyographic-driven model and input to a finite
                 element analysis. Hydrostatic and octahedral shear
                 stresses within the cartilage were modeled with the
                 tibiofemoral joint in a neutral position and also with the
                 femur rotated internally or externally by 5 degrees
                 increments to +/-15 degrees . Cartilage stresses were more
                 sensitive to external rotation of the femur, compared with
                 internal rotation, with large variation across subjects.
                 Peak patellar shear stresses increased more than 10\% with
                 15 degrees of external rotation in 75\% of the subjects.
                 Shear stresses were higher in the patellar cartilage
                 compared to the femoral cartilage and patellar cartilage
                 stresses were more sensitive to femoral rotation compared
                 with femoral cartilage stress. Large variation in the
                 cartilage stress response between individuals reflects the
                 complex nature of the extensor mechanism and has clinical
                 relevance when considering treatment strategies designed
                 to reduce cartilage stresses by altering femoral internal
                 and external rotation.",

                 artery occlusion were demonstrated by using an
                 epicardial mapping technique in anesthetized open-chest
                 dogs. Intermittent occlusion of a left anterior
                 descending coronary artery branch resulted in a marked
                 elevation of the ST segment above the baseline in the
                 areas of the myocardium supplied by this vessel.
                 Repeated occlusions after administration of normal
                 saline as a control produced less ST-segment elevation
                 thn that noted during control occlusions; however,
                 repeated occlusions after infusion of quinidine
                 produced a further lessening in ST-segment elevation.
                 Our investigations show that epicardial mapping tended
                 to underestimate the area of injury, and this limits
                 the interpretation of drug intervention studies such as
                 those in which quinidine is administered. Therefore,
                 caution should be exerted when using epicardial mapping

                 have been calculated using both frequency domain and time
                 complex analyses. Direct comparisons of these methods are
                 limited. We report: (1) their correlation when measuring
                 AF activation rates, (2) comparisons of recording
                 durations required to minimize variability, and (3)
                 differences in the temporal reproducibility. Methods: AF
                 activation rates were calculated using domain frequency
                 (DF) (via fast Fourier transform) and time complex (TC)
                 (via beat-to-beat activation measurements) analyses. We
                 compared: (1) AF frequencies derived from each method; (2)
                 successively longer subinterval durations to their
                 16-second reference intervals, and (3) the correlation
                 between consecutively collected 8-second segments and
                 segments collected 10 minutes apart. Results: There was
                 low intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC = 0.234) when
                 comparing AF activation rates derived using DF versus TC
                 analysis. There was no difference in the frequencies
                 between any of the subintervals compared to their
                 16-second reference intervals, but variability of
                 measurements was higher for intervals <8 seconds (P <
                 0.01). Correlations between successive segments and
                 segments taken 10 minutes apart were 0.92 and 0.75 using
                 DF analysis (P < 0.001), and 0.72 and 0.49 using TC
                 analysis (P < 0.001). Conclusions: There is low
                 correlation between the DF and TC methods of analyzing AF
                 activation rates. While AF rates do not differ between
                 subintervals and 16-second reference electrograms, the
                 variability of measurements is dependent upon the
                 subinterval duration, and increases for durations less
                 than 8 seconds. AF rates were prone to change over a
                 10-minute time period. These results point out existing
                 clinical limitations of measuring atrial activation rates
                 in AF patients. (PACE 2011; 34:540-548).",

                 and to simulate surgical treatments. Musculoskeletal
                 models have historically been created based on data
                 derived in anatomical and biomechanical studies of
                 cadaveric specimens. MRI offers an abundance of novel
                 methods for acquisition of data from living subjects and
                 is revolutionizing the field of musculoskeletal modeling.
                 The need to create accurate, individualized models of the
                 musculoskeletal system is driving advances in MRI
                 techniques including static imaging, dynamic imaging,
                 diffusion imaging, body imaging, pulse-sequence design,
                 and coil design. These techniques apply to imaging
                 musculoskeletal anatomy, muscle architecture, joint
                 motions, muscle moment arms, and muscle tissue
                 deformations. Further advancements in image-based
                 musculoskeletal modeling will expand the accuracy and

                 risk stratification in patients with coronary heart
                 disease. Our previous study showed that QT dispersion
                 assessed immediately after bicycle exercise test was
                 significantly higher in patients with coronary stenoses
                 of > 50\% as compared to the patients without coronary
                 artery disease. Despite some controversial data,
                 several studies showed that QT dispersion is a
                 significant predictor of cardiovascular mortality.
                 Heart rate variability representing a relationship
                 between the autonomic nervous system and cardiovascular
                 mortality, including sudden cardiac death, is one of
                 the most promising markers. The predictive value of
                 heart rate variability is independent of other factors
                 established for postinfarction risk stratification,
                 such as depressed left ventricular ejection fraction,
                 increased ventricular ectopic activity, and presence of
                 late potentials. For prediction of all-cause mortality,
                 the value of heart rate variability is similar to that
                 of left ventricular ejection fraction, but heart rate
                 variability is superior to left ventricular ejection
                 fraction in predicting arrhythmic events (sudden
                 cardiac death and ventricular tachycardia).",

                 extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins are expressed
                 differently in the left atrial tissue of patients in
                 sinus rhythm (SR), lone atrial fibrillation (AF), and
                 AF with underlying mitral valve disease (MVD). DESIGN:
                 Case-control study. PATIENTS: 118 patients with lone
                 AF, MVD+AF, and SR. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Collagen I,
                 collagen III, and fibronectin protein expression
                 measured by quantitative western blotting techniques
                 and immunohistochemical methods. RESULTS: Protein
                 concentrations increased in patients with AF (all
                 forms) compared with those in SR (all forms): collagen
                 I (1.15 (0.11) v 0.45 (0.28), respectively; p = 0.002),
                 collagen III (0.74 (0.05) v 0.46 (0.11); p = 0.002, and
                 fibronectin (0.88 (0.06) v 0.62 (0.13); p = 0.08).
                 Especially, collagen I was similarly enhanced in both
                 lone AF (1.49 (0.15) and MVD+AF (1.53 (0.16) compared
                 with SR (0.56 (0.28); both p = 0.01). Collagen III was
                 not significantly increased in lone AF but was
                 significantly increased in AF combined with MVD (0.84
                 (0.07) both compared with SR (0.46 (0.11); p = 0.01).
                 The concentration of fibronectin was not significantly
                 increased in lone AF and MVD+AF (both compared with
                 SR). Furthermore, there was a similar degree of
                 enhanced collagen expression in paroxysmal AF and
                 chronic AF. CONCLUSIONS: AF is associated with
                 fibrosis. Forms of AF differ from each other in
                 collagen III expression. However, there was no
                 systematic difference in ECM expression between
                 paroxysmal AF and chronic AF. Enhanced concentrations
                 of ECM proteins may have a role in structural
                 remodelling and the pathogenesis of AF as a result of
                 separation of the cells by fibrotic depositions.",

                 in patients with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder

                 psychopharmacological treatment approaches due to its
                 local and network effects on brain activation. In the
                 current study, we investigated the impact of tDCS over the
                 right inferior frontal gyrus (rIFG) on interference
                 control in 21 male adolescents with ADHD and 21 age
                 matched healthy controls aged 13-17 years, who underwent
                 three separate sessions of tDCS (anodal, cathodal, and
                 sham) while completing a Flanker task. Even though anodal
                 stimulation appeared to diminish commission errors in the
                 ADHD group, the overall analysis revealed no significant
                 effect of tDCS. Since participants showed a considerable
                 learning effect from the first to the second session,
                 performance in the first session was separately analyzed.
                 ADHD patients receiving sham stimulation in the first
                 session showed impaired interference control compared to
                 healthy control participants whereas ADHD patients who
                 were exposed to anodal stimulation, showed comparable
                 performance levels (commission errors, reaction time
                 variability) to the control group. These results suggest
                 that anodal tDCS of the right inferior frontal gyrus could

                 resonance scan was used to produce a specific thoracic
                 model consisting of 5-mm cubes. The forward model uses
                 the finite difference method to compute a forward
                 transfer matrix that relates each of 26 epicardial
                 regions to body surface measurements. Amplitude

  robnote =      "BACKGROUND: Body-surface ECG measures (QT dispersion
                 [QTd], QRST integrals) have been used as indices of
                 myocardial repolarization abnormalities with the goal
                 of identifying patients at risk of fatal arrhythmias.
                 The clinical utility of these measures has been
                 questioned. We investigate the complex relationship
                 between epicardial and body-surface potentials in the
                 context of regionally abnormal myocardial
                 repolarization. METHODS AND RESULTS: Epicardial
                 potentials were recorded with a 224-electrode sock from
                 an open-chest dog during control, regional epicardial
                 warming, cooling, and adjacent warming and cooling to
                 induce localized alterations in myocardial
                 repolarization and regions of increased repolarization
                 dispersion. Body-surface potentials were generated from
                 these epicardial potentials in a human torso model.
                 Epicardial estimates of repolarization (activation
                 recovery intervals [ARIs] and QRST integrals) were
                 evaluated for their ability to identify regions with
                 increased repolarization dispersion. Body-surface QRST
                 integrals and QTd in 12-lead ECG and 64-lead
                 body-surface potential maps were evaluated for their
                 ability to detect increased dispersion of myocardial
                 repolarization. Epicardial ARI and QRST integral maps
                 successfully located epicardial regions with increased
                 dispersion of repolarization. The increased dispersion
                 was not consistently reflected in the 12-lead or
                 64-lead ECG QTd or in the body-surface QRST integral
                 maps. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates the
                 inadequacy of body-surface measures that are thought to
                 reflect myocardial dispersion of repolarization. In
                 contrast, measures based on epicardial electrograms
                 (ARI or epicardial QRST integral maps) provide
                 physiologically relevant information about myocardial
                 repolarization and can locate regions of increased
                 dispersion.",

                  differentially to pathological stimuli has not been
                  examined. METHODS AND RESULTS: We compared various
                  morphological, secretory, and proliferative response indexes
                  of canine atrial versus ventricular fibroblasts.  Cultured
                  atrial fibroblasts showed faster cell surface area increases,
                  distinct morphology at confluence, and greater alpha-smooth
                  muscle actin expression than ventricular
                  fibroblasts. Congestive heart failure atria showed larger
                  fractions of fibroblasts in mitotic phases compared with
                  ventricles and displayed enhanced gene expression of
                  fibroblast-selective markers (collagen-1, collagen-3,

                  differently than ventricular fibroblasts over a range of in
                  vitro and in vivo paradigms, with atrial fibroblasts showing
                  enhanced reactivity that may explain greater atrial fibrotic
                  responses. PDGF signaling is particularly important for
                  atrium-selective fibroblast responses and may represent a

                 First, detailed endocardial maps were done in 5 normal
                 pigs and 7 pigs 6 to 10 weeks after left anterior
                 descending coronary artery infarction to characterize
                 electrograms in normal and infarcted tissue by
                 electroanatomic mapping (CARTO, Biosense). Electrogram
                 recording sites were verified by intracardiac echo
                 (ICE, 9 MHz) and grouped by location: infarct (area of
                 akinesis by ICE), border (0.5-cm perimeter of akinetic
                 area), and remote. Compared with remote sites,
                 electrograms from infarct sites had smaller amplitudes
                 (1.2+/-0.5 versus 5.1+/-2.1 mV, P<0.001), longer
                 durations (74.2+/-26.3 versus 36.3+/-6.4 ms, P<0.001),
                 and more frequent notched or late components. Border
                 zone electrograms were intermediate in amplitude and
                 duration. Second, infarct characterization by
                 electroanatomic mapping was compared with pathological
                 (exclusion of triphenyltetrazolium chloride staining)
                 and ICE measurements. Infarct size by pathology
                 correlated with the area defined by contiguous

                 defined by contiguous electrograms with amplitude </=2
                 mV (r=0.95, P=0.0016). CONCLUSIONS: Electroanatomic
                 mapping during sinus rhythm allows accurate 3D
                 characterization of infarct architecture and defines
                 the relationship of electrophysiological and anatomic

                 during 108 EP procedures (2.6+/-0.5 per patient).
                 Seventeen patients underwent 2 procedures, 23 patients
                 underwent 3 procedures, and 3 patients underwent 4
                 procedures. During the first attempt, electrical
                 disconnection was achieved in 112 PVs (95.7\%). During
                 a next procedure (time interval, 4.6+/-1.9 months),
                 conduction recurrence was observed in 32 of 39 LSPVs
                 (82.1\%), 29 of 40 RSPVs (72.5\%), 20 of 24 LIPVs
                 (83.3\%), and 7 of 9 RIPV (77.8\%). After reablation at
                 gap sites, a later procedure (time interval, 5.1+/-2.4
                 months) revealed a second recurrence in 13 of 22 LSPVs
                 (59.1\%) and 14 of 19 RSPVs (73.7\%). CONCLUSIONS:
                 Conduction recurrence across disconnecting RF lesions
                 can be observed in approximately 80\% of cases 4 months
                 after ablation. After reablation, similar recurrence
                 rates are observed 5 months later. This high rate of
                 late conduction recurrence may contribute significantly
                 to AF recurrence in patients undergoing catheter
                 ablation aiming at disconnection of multiple PVs.",

                 temperature noninvasively with magnetic resonance
                 imaging during hyperthermia treatment of human tumors.
                 METHODS: The proton chemical shift detected using
                 phase-difference magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was
                 used to measure temperature in phantoms and human
                 tumors during treatment with hyperthermia. Four adult
                 patients having high-grade primary sarcoma tumors of
                 the lower leg received 5 hyperthermia treatments in the
                 MR scanner using an MRI-compatible radiofrequency
                 heating applicator. Prior to each treatment, an average
                 of 3 fiberoptic temperature probes were invasively
                 placed into the tumor (or phantom). Hyperthermia was
                 applied concurrent with MR thermometry. Following
                 completion of the treatment, regions of interest (ROI)
                 were defined on MR phase images at each temperature
                 probe location, in bone marrow, and in gel standards
                 placed outside the heated region. The median phase
                 difference (compared to pretreatment baseline images)
                 was calculated for each ROI. This phase difference was
                 corrected for phase drift observed in standards and
                 bone marrow. The observed phase difference, with and
                 without corrections, was correlated with the fiberoptic
                 temperature measurements. RESULTS: The phase difference
                 observed with MRI was found to correlate with
                 temperature. Phantom measurements demonstrated a linear
                 regression coefficient of 4.70 degrees phase difference
                 per degree Celsius, with an R2 = 0.998. After human
                 images with artifact were excluded, the linear
                 regression demonstrated a correlation coefficient of
                 5.5 degrees phase difference per degree Celsius, with
                 an R2 = 0.84. In both phantom and human treatments,
                 temperature measured via corrected phase difference
                 closely tracked measurements obtained with fiberoptic
                 probes during the hyperthermia treatments. CONCLUSIONS:
                 Proton chemical shift imaging with current MRI and
                 hyperthermia technology can be used to monitor and
                 control temperature during treatment of large tumors in
                 the distal lower extremity.",

                 thrombogenesis; however, many aspects of shape variation
                 in the heart are poorly understood. To date, studies of
                 the LA shape in AF have been limited to empirical

                 significant group differences between the normal control
                 and AF patient populations (n = 137) and (2) we describe
                 characteristic shapes of the LA appendage that are
                 associated with the risk of thrombogenesis determined by
                 transesophageal echocardiography (n = 203).",

                 heart failure (CHF) produce discrete forms of atrial
                 ionic remodeling. The in vivo effects of atrial
                 tachycardia (AT) remodeling are altered by CHF. This
                 study evaluated underlying mechanisms at the level of
                 ionic remodeling. METHODS AND RESULTS: We studied 4
                 groups of dogs: (1) unpaced controls (CTLs); (2) CHF
                 caused by 2-week ventricular tachypacing (VTP, 240
                 bpm); (3) AT (400 bpm x 7 days); and (4) CHF+AT (2-week
                 VTP with AT for the last 7 days). CHF and CHF+AT groups
                 equally increased left atrial pressure. AF duration was
                 increased in all paced groups. Effective refractory
                 period (ERP) was decreased by 42\\% in AT versus CTL but
                 by only 24\% in AT+CHF versus CHF. CHF reduced L-type
                 Ca2+ (I(Ca)), transient-outward (I(to)), and the slow
                 delayed-rectifier (I(Ks)) currents while increasing the
                 Na+-Ca2+ exchanger (I(NCX)) and not affecting the
                 inward-rectifier (I(K1)) current. AT reduced I(to) and
                 I(Ca) while increasing I(K1) and leaving I(Ks)
                 unaltered. The addition of AT to CHF failed to alter
                 I(to), I(Ks), or I(NCX) beyond the effect of CHF alone,
                 decreased I(Ca) slightly compared with CHF alone, but
                 had smaller effects on I(Ca) and I(K1) compared with AT
                 alone. Thus, CHF+AT, as would occur in a CHF patient
                 who develops AF, produced an ionic remodeling pattern
                 different from that of CHF or AT alone and from what
                 would have been predicted from additive effects of CHF
                 and AT. CONCLUSIONS: The presence of CHF alters
                 AT-induced ionic remodeling. Thus, the ionic remodeling
                 x caused by cardiac arrhythmias in the presence of
                 cardiac pathology is not necessarily predictable from
                 the effects of either alone, with important potential
                 implications for understanding the pathophysiology of
                 arrhythmias in the diseased heart.",

                 ionic versus structural remodeling in CHF-related
                 atrial fibrillation (AF) is controversial. METHODS AND
                 RESULTS: We measured hemodynamic and echocardiographic
                 parameters, mean duration of burst pacing-induced AF
                 (DAF), and atrial-myocyte ionic currents in dogs with
                 CHF induced by 2-week ventricular tachypacing (240
                 bpm), CHF dogs allowed to recover without pacing for 4
                 weeks (REC), and unpaced controls. Left ventricular
                 ejection fraction averaged 58.6+/-1.2\% (control),
                 36.2+/-2.3\% (CHF, P<0.01), and 57.9+/-1.6\% (REC),
                 indicating full hemodynamic recovery. Similarly, left
                 atrial pressures were 2.2+/-0.3 (control), 13.1+/-1.5
                 (CHF), and 2.4+/-0.4 (REC) mm Hg. CHF reduced I(to)
                 density by approximately 65\% (P<0.01), decreased
                 I(Ca,L) density by approximately 50\% (P<0.01), and
                 diminished I(Ks) density by approximately 40\% (P<0.01)
                 while increasing I(NCX) density by approximately 110\%
                 (P<0.05). In REC, all ionic current densities returned
                 to control values. DAF increased in CHF (1132+/-207
                 versus 14.3+/-8.8 seconds, control) and remained
                 increased with REC (1014+/-252 seconds). Atrial fibrous
                 tissue content also increased in CHF (2.1+/-0.2\% for
                 control versus 10.2+/-0.7\% for CHF, P<0.01), with no
                 recovery observed in REC (9.4+/-0.8\%, P<0.01 versus
                 control, P=NS versus CHF). CONCLUSIONS: With reversal
                 of CHF, there is complete recovery of ionic remodeling,
                 but the prolonged-AF substrate and structural
                 remodeling remain. This suggests that structural, not
                 ionic, remodeling is the primary contributor to AF
                 maintenance in experimental CHF.",

                 fibrillation (AF) patients with impaired left
                 ventricular (LV) systolic function. BACKGROUND: To
                 date, PVI has been performed primarily in patients with
                 normal LV function. Yet, many AF patients have impaired
                 LV systolic function. The outcomes of PVI in patients
                 with impaired LV systolic function are unknown.
                 METHODS: We included 377 consecutive patients
                 undergoing PVI between December 2000 and January 2003.
                 Ninety-four patients had impaired LV function (ejection
                 fraction [EF] <40\%), and they comprised the study
                 group. The control group was the remaining 283 patients
                 who had a normal EF. End points included AF recurrence
                 and changes in EF and quality of life (QoL). RESULTS:
                 Mean EF was 36\% in our study group, compared with 54\%
                 in controls. After initial PVI, 73\% of patients with
                 impaired EF and 87\% of patients with normal EF were
                 free of AF recurrence at 14 +/- 6 months (p = 0.03). In
                 the study group, there was a nonsignificant increase in
                 EF of 4.6\% and significant improvement in QoL.
                 Complication rates were low and included a 1\% risk of
                 pulmonary vein stenosis. CONCLUSIONS: Although the AF
                 recurrence rate after initial PVI in impaired EF
                 patients was higher than in normal EF subjects, nearly
                 three-fourths of patients with impaired EF remained
                 AF-free. Although our sample size was nonrandomized,
                 our results suggest PVI may be a feasible therapeutic
                 option in AF patients with impaired EF. Randomized

                 atrial fibrillation (AF). We hypothesized that a
                 monozygotic (MZ) twin whose co-twin was diagnosed with AF
                 would have an increased risk of the disease compared with
                 a dizygotic (DZ) twin in the same situation. METHODS AND
                 RESULTS: A sample of 1137 same-sex twin pairs (356 MZ and
                 781 DZ pairs) in which one or both members were diagnosed
                 with AF were identified in The Danish Twin Registry.
                 Concordance rates were twice as high for MZ pairs than for
                 DZ pairs regardless of sex (22.0\% versus 11.6\%,
                 P<0.0001). In a Cox regression of event-free survival
                 times, we compared the time span between occurrences of
                 disease in MZ and DZ twins. The unaffected twin was
                 included when his or her twin-sibling (the index twin) was
                 diagnosed with AF. After adjustment for age at entry, MZ
                 twins had a significantly shorter event-free survival time
                 (hazard ratio, 2.0; 95\% CI, 1.3 to 3.0), thereby
                 indicating a genetic component. Using biometric models, we
                 estimated the heritability of AF to be 62\% (55\% to
                 68\%), due to additive genetics. There were no significant
                 differences across sexes. CONCLUSIONS: All the analyses of
                 twin similarities in the present study indicate that
                 genetic factors play a substantial role in the risk of AF
                 for both sexes. The recurrence risk for co-twins (12\% to
                 22\%) is clinically relevant and suggests that co-twins of
                 AF-affected twins belong to a high-risk group for AF.",

  robnote =      "BACKGROUND: Dominant frequency (DF) analysis is sometimes
                 limited in its characterization of atrial fibrillation
                 (AF), thus better methodology is needed. OBJECTIVE: To
                 develop methods for analyzing the AF signal without
                 transformation to frequency space, and to compare the
                 methods to DF analysis using both real and simulated data.
                 METHOD: Electrograms were obtained in 11 patients with
                 paroxysmal or persistent AF. Atrial rate (AR) was
                 estimated retrospectively from 8.4-s intervals acquired at
                 8 sites, using DF and 2 new methods: (1) Signals were
                 converted into merged deflections (time complexes [TC]).
                 Mean peak-to-peak cycle length was used to estimate AR.
                 (2) The ensemble average (EA) was calculated with window
                 size (w) ranging from 50 to 500 ms (frequency f = 2 to 20
                 Hz). The dominant peak in the root-mean-square power
                 spectrum of EA versus w was used to estimate AR. Methods
                 were compared using patient data, and in simulations using
                 a Hanning pulse (2-mV peak, 50-ms duration, 120-ms period)
                 with additive random noise, amplitude changes, and phase
                 shift. Data from 10 atrial flutter patients were used to
                 validate rate estimation under static conditions. RESULTS:
                 From pooled AF data (N = 88 sites), mean atrial rate was
                 5.71 Hz (EA), 5.96 Hz (TC), and 5.72 Hz (DF). The mean
                 absolute rate difference was 0.65 Hz (EA-TC), 0.58 Hz
                 (EA-DF), and 0.50 Hz (TC-DF). In simulations, DF, TC, and
                 EA, respectively, correctly predicted rate with additive
                 random noise up to 0.13 mV, 1.4 mV, and 15.2 mV, random
                 phase shift up to 46.3 ms, 28.8 ms, and 51.3 ms, and
                 random amplitude variation ranging from 0 to 4 mV, 1.3 to
                 2.7 mV, and 0 to 4 mV. All methods accurately estimated
                 rate during atrial flutter. CONCLUSIONS: Accurate rate
                 estimation depends on signal periodicity and is influenced
                 by random noise. The EA provides an accurate rate estimate
                 of the periodic component of AF even at high noise levels.",

                 METHOD: Capsule endoscopy videoclip images (576 x 576
                 pixels) were acquired at 2/second frame rate (11 celiacs,
                 10 controls) at regions: 1. bulb, 2. duodenum, 3. jejunum,
                 4. ileum and 5. distal ileum. Each of 200 images per
                 videoclip (= 100s) were subdivided into 10 x 10 pixel
                 subimages for which mean grayscale brightness level and
                 its standard deviation (texture) were calculated. Pooled
                 subimage values were grouped into low, intermediate, and
                 high texture bands, and mean brightness, texture, and
                 number of subimages in each band (nine features in all)
                 were used for quantifying regions 1-5, and to determine
                 the three best features for threshold and incremental
                 learning classification. Classifiers were developed using
                 6 celiac and 5 control patients' data as exemplars, and
                 tested on 5 celiacs and 5 controls. RESULTS: Pooled from
                 all regions, the threshold classifier had 80\% sensitivity
                 and 96\% specificity and the incremental classifier had
                 88\% sensitivity and 80\% specificity for predicting
                 celiac versus control videoclips in the test set. Trends
                 of increasing texture from regions 1 to 5 occurred in the
                 low and high texture bands in celiacs, and the number of
                 subimages in the low texture band diminished (r(2) > 0.5).
                 No trends occurred in controls. CONCLUSIONS: Celiac
                 videocapsule images have textural properties that vary
                 linearly along the small intestine. Quantitative markers

                 (CFAEs) may represent a phenomenon associated with sources
                 of atrial fibrillation (AF) and are being used
                 increasingly as targets of catheter ablation. However,
                 current methods have limited efficacy for characterizing
                 CFAEs important to substrate arrhythmogenicity and do not
                 measure electrogram morphology. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of
                 this study was to develop a methodology for quantifying
                 the degree of morphologic heterogeneity in CFAE
                 deflections, and to determine whether there are
                 differences in this measurement between paroxysmal and
                 persistent AF patients. METHODS: Two successive bipolar
                 CFAEs of length 8.4 seconds each were acquired during AF
                 from two sites each at the ostia of the four pulmonary
                 veins (PVs) and from the anterior and posterior left
                 atrial free wall in patients with paroxysmal AF (N = 10)
                 and long-standing persistent AF (N = 10). Extrinsic and
                 intrinsic features of electrogram shape were used to
                 characterize fractionation in CFAE sequences. The
                 extrinsic parameters were the amplitude, upslope,
                 downslope, and width of each deflection. The intrinsic
                 parameter was the voltage profile as characterized by the
                 sum of absolute values. These measurements were compared
                 to the mean interval between CFAE deflections, a standard
                 fractionation indicator. RESULTS: The variability of
                 intrinsic/extrinsic morphologic parameters was higher in
                 paroxysmal than persistent AF at the left superior PV (P <
                 or =.003), the posterior left atrial free wall, anterior
                 left atrial free wall, left inferior PV, and right
                 superior PV (P <.05 for most parameters), and the right
                 inferior PV (not significant). Mean CFAE deflection
                 intervals were longer at all locations in paroxysmal AF
                 but were significant only at the left superior PV and
                 posterior left atrial free wall (P <.05). Quantitative
                 morphologic parameters were not well correlated with
                 dominant frequency (r(2) <0.32); thus, our new measures
                 are robust to changes in activation rate. CONCLUSION: A
                 novel method for quantifying CFAEs, independent of
                 activation rate, has been developed. The method
                 demonstrates greater significance in the difference
                 between CFAE morphology in paroxysmal and long-standing AF
                 compared with mean interval between CFAE deflections. The
                 differences identified suggest that CFAE morphology may
                 evolve as AF persists.",

                 also become important markers for identifying potential
                 mechanisms of AF, yet inaccuracies exist, particularly in
                 standard dominant frequency (SDF) calculations especially
                 at CFAE sites. We developed new methodology to improve
                 accuracy of AF rate determinations at such recording
                 sites. OBJECTIVE: To develop optimal methods for
                 estimating activation rates in paroxysmal and persistent
                 AF. METHODS: Electrograms were obtained from one right
                 atrial, coronary sinus, and 6 left atrial (LA) endocardial
                 regions manifesting CFAEs in paroxysmal (N = 7) and
                 persistent (N = 7) AF patients. SDF was measured from 8.4
                 s intervals and compared to (1) optimized DF (ODF)
                 calculated by optimizing the filter coefficients which
                 maximized dominant frequency power, (2) autocorrelation
                 (AC), with the rate estimated as the inverse of the signal
                 phase shift generating the largest autocorrelation
                 coefficient, and (3) ensemble average (EA), with the rate
                 estimated by summing successive signal segments and
                 selecting segment length yielding maximum power. Rate
                 measurements were compared between groups, at baseline and
                 with additive interference, having similar frequency
                 content to the electrograms, to test the robustness of the
                 different methods. RESULTS: From pooled data (N = 168
                 recording sites), a significantly higher LA dominant
                 frequency was found in persistent versus paroxysmal
                 patients using each method (P < 0.001), with a mean value
                 for all methods of 6.23 +/- 0.08 Hz versus 5.32 +/- 0.10
                 Hz, respectively. At the highest additive interference
                 level, the rate measurement error was significantly
                 greater in SDF as compared with EA (P = 0.010) and ODF (P
                 = 0.035), and at all interference levels SDF had the
                 largest error of any method. CONCLUSIONS: SDF appears less
                 robust to additive interference, compared to the ODF and
                 EA methods of estimating the activation rate at CFAE sites
                 in this small group of patients. Use of optimized filter
                 coefficients for DF measurement, or use of correlative
                 methods such as EA, that reinforce the signal rather than
                 filtering the noise, may improve calculation of activation
                 rates.",

                 border zone, monomorphic re-entrant ventricular
                 tachycardia (MVT) was repeatedly induced by programmed
                 electrical stimulation (14 experiments, total of 23
                 instances used for analysis). Ventricular fibrillation
                 (VF) and polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (PVT)
                 occasionally occurred (total of 23 and 4 episodes,
                 respectively, for all experiments). For each of 196 to 312
                 border zone bipolar electrode recordings, the DF and DF
                 spatial derivative (DFD) were calculated to assess
                 electrical activity organization and were used to classify
                 VTAs at onset. For classification, measurements were made
                 at 1.5 and 3 seconds from last stimulus for all recording
                 sites, and at 2.25 and 3 seconds for 3- to 7-site subsets
                 as a test with limited data. RESULTS: At 1.5 seconds after
                 stimulus end, the DF/DFD magnitudes were ordered: MVT <
                 PVT < VF (P < .001). DF/DFD trended upward in VF, downward
                 in MVT, and lacked trend in PVT (P < .001). Based on
                 DF/DFD magnitudes/trends, the MVT/VF classifier accuracy
                 was 94.6\% (all sites/1.5 s), 97.9\% (all sites/3 s),
                 82.6\% (subset sites/2.25 s), and 86.3\% (subset sites/3
                 s). CONCLUSION: VTAs are distinguishable at early onset by
                 degree and trend in organization of electrical activity as
                 estimated by DF and DFD. VF becomes increasingly
                 disorganized, MVT becomes increasingly organized, and PVT
                 remains intermediate. It may be possible to apply this

                 biophysical sources using Fourier analysis can be
                 inefficient because the basis is sinusoidal and general.
                 When complex fractionated atrial electrograms (CFAE) are
                 acquired during atrial fibrillation (AF), the electrogram
                 morphology depends on the mix of distinct nonsinusoidal
                 generators. Identification of these generators using
                 efficient methods of representation and comparison would
                 be useful for targeting catheter ablation sites to prevent
                 arrhythmia reinduction. METHOD: A data-driven basis and
                 transform is described which utilizes the ensemble average
                 of signal segments to identify and distinguish CFAE
                 morphologic components and frequencies. Calculation of the
                 dominant frequency (DF) of actual CFAE, and identification
                 of simulated independent generator frequencies and
                 morphologies embedded in CFAE, is done using a total of
                 216 recordings from 10 paroxysmal and 10 persistent AF
                 patients. The transform is tested versus Fourier analysis
                 to detect spectral components in the presence of phase
                 noise and interference. Correspondence is shown between
                 ensemble basis vectors of highest power and corresponding
                 synthetic drivers embedded in CFAE. RESULTS: The ensemble
                 basis is orthogonal, and efficient for representation of
                 CFAE components as compared with Fourier analysis
                 (p<=0.002). When three synthetic drivers with additive
                 phase noise and interference were decomposed, the top
                 three peaks in the ensemble power spectrum corresponded to
                 the driver frequencies more closely as compared with top
                 Fourier power spectrum peaks (p<=0.005). The synthesized
                 drivers with phase noise and interference were extractable
                 from their corresponding ensemble basis with a mean error
                 of less than 10\%. CONCLUSIONS: The new transform is able
                 to efficiently identify CFAE features using DF calculation
                 and by discerning morphologic differences. Unlike the
                 Fourier transform method, it does not distort CFAE signals
                 prior to analysis, and is relatively robust to jitter in
                 periodic events. Thus the ensemble method can provide a
                 useful alternative for quantitative characterization of
                 CFAE during clinical study.",

  robnote =      "BACKGROUND: -Complex fractionated atrial electrograms
                 (CFAE) are morphologically more uniform in persistent
                 longstanding as compared with paroxysmal atrial
                 fibrillation (AF). It was hypothesized that this may
                 result from a greater degree of repetitiveness in CFAE
                 patterns at disparate left atrial (LA) sites in
                 longstanding AF. METHODS AND RESULTS: -CFAEs were obtained
                 from recording sites outside the four pulmonary vein (PV)
                 ostia, and at a posterior and an anterior LA site, during
                 paroxysmal and longstanding persistent AF (10 patients
                 each, 120 sequences total). To quantify repetitiveness in
                 CFAE, the dominant frequency (DF) was measured from
                 ensemble spectra using 8.4-second sequences, and
                 repetitiveness was calculated by two novel techniques,
                 linear prediction and Fourier reconstruction methods.
                 Lower prediction and reconstruction errors were considered
                 indicative of increasing repetitiveness and decreasing
                 randomness. In paroxysmal AF patients, CFAE pattern
                 repetitiveness was significantly lower (randomness higher)
                 at antral sites outside PV ostia, as compared with LA free
                 wall sites (p<0.001). In longstanding AF, repetitiveness
                 increased outside the PV ostia especially outside the left
                 superior PV ostium, and diminished at the LA free wall
                 sites. The result was that in persistent AF, there were no
                 significant site-specific differences in CFAE
                 repetitiveness at the selected LA locations used in this
                 study. Average DF magnitude was 5.32+/-0.29Hz in
                 paroxysmal AF and higher in longstanding AF at
                 6.27+/-0.13Hz (p<0.001), with the frequency of local
                 activation approaching a common upper bound for all sites.
                 CONCLUSIONS: -In paroxysmal AF, CFAE repetitiveness is low
                 and randomness high outside the PVs, particularly the left
                 superior PV. As evolution to persistent, longstanding AF
                 occurs, CFAE repetitiveness becomes more uniformly
                 distributed at disparate sites, possibly signifying an
                 increasing number of drivers from remote PVs.",

                 subunit of the rapidly activating component of the
                 cardiac delayed rectifier I(Kr), have been found to
                 underlie the congenital Long-QT syndrome, LQT2. LQT2
                 may give rise to severe arrhythmogenic phenotypes
                 leading to sudden cardiac death. OBJECTIVE: We attempt
                 to elucidate the mechanisms by which heterogeneous LQT2
                 genotypes can lead to prolongation of the action
                 potential duration (APD) and consequently the QT
                 interval on the ECG. METHODS: We develop Markovian
                 models of wild-type (WT) and mutant I(Kr) channels and
                 incorporate these models into a comprehensive model of
                 the cardiac ventricular cell. RESULTS: Using this
                 virtual transgenic cell model, we describe the effects
                 of HERG mutations on the cardiac ventricular action
                 potential (AP) and provide insight into the mechanism
                 by which each defect results in a net loss of
                 repolarizing current and prolongation of APD.
                 CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates which mutations
                 can prolong APD sufficiently to generate early
                 afterdepolarizations (EADs), which may trigger
                 life-threatening arrhythmias. The severity of the
                 phenotype is shown to depend on the specific kinetic
                 changes and how they affect I(Kr) during the time
                 course of the action potential. Clarifying how defects
                 in HERG can lead to impaired cellular electrophysiology
                 can improve our understanding of the link between
                 channel structure and cellular function.",

                 cellular environment, leading to altered cell function.
                 As ion-channel defects are typically studied in

                 body-surface electrocardiograms. Solving this problem is
                 beneficial to clinical practice. However, reconstructions
                 cannot be obtained straightforwardly due to the ill-posed
                 nature of this problem. Therefore, regularization schemes

                 potential to revolutionize diagnostics and therapy of
                 cardiac pathologies. Due to the requirement of
                 noninvasiveness, body-surface potentials are measured and
                 have to be projected back to the heart surface, yielding
                 an ill-posed inverse problem. Ill-posedness ensures that
                 there are non-unique solutions to this problem, resulting
                 in a problem of choice. In the current paper, it is
                 proposed to restrict this choice by requiring that the
                 time series of reconstructed heart-surface potentials is
                 sparse in the wavelet domain. A local search technique is
                 introduced that pursues a sparse solution, using an
                 orthogonal wavelet transform. Epicardial potentials
                 reconstructed from this method are compared to those from
                 existing methods, and validated with actual intracardiac
                 recordings. The new technique improves the reconstructions

                 imaging, could fill the gap between the noninvasive
                 (low-resolution) 12-lead ECG and invasive
                 (high-resolution) electrophysiology studies. Much progress
                 has been made to establish electrocardiographic imaging,
                 and clinical studies appear with increasing frequency.
                 However, many assumptions and model choices are involved
                 in its execution, and only limited validation has been

                 surface electrocardiographic (ECG) mapping (BSM) and
                 imaging. Twenty-seven patients referred
                 for electrophysiologic procedures in the context of
                 ventricular tachycardia (VT) (n = 9),
                 Wolff-Parkinson-White (WPW) syndrome (n = 2), atrial
                 fibrillation (AF) (n = 13), or scar-related ventricular
                 fibrillation (VF) (n = 3) were examined. 
                 Acquisition, segmentation, and registration were feasible
                 in all patients. In VT, this enabled a noninvasive
                 assessment of the arrhythmia mechanism and its location
                 with respect to the myocardial substrate, coronary
                 vessels, and phrenic nerve. In WPW syndrome, this enabled
                 understanding of complex accessory pathways resistant to
                 previous ablation. In AF and VF, this enabled the
                 noninvasive assessment of arrhythmia mechanisms and the
                 analysis of rotor trajectories with respect to the
                 myocardial substrate. In all patients, models were

                 repolarization sequences and on the distribution of
                 APDs in the ventricles. We implement a Monodomain

                 or heterogeneous transmural intrinsic membrane

                 trilinear finite elements in space and a semi-implicit
                 adaptive method in time. Simulations of excitation and
                 repolarization sequences elicited by epicardial or
                 endocardial pacing show that in a homogeneous slab the
                 repolarization pathways approximately follow the

                 cases considered in this study, we observed two
                 repolarization wavefronts that started from the epi and
                 the endocardial faces respectively and collided in the
                 thickness of the wall and in one case an additional
                 repolarization wave starting from an intramural site.
                 Introducing the heterogeneities along the transmural
                 epi-endocardial direction affected both the
                 repolarization sequence and the APD dispersion, but
                 these effects were clearly discernible only in
                 transmural planes. By contrast, in planes parallel to
                 epi- and endocardium the APD distribution remained
                 remarkably similar to that observed in the homogeneous

  abstract =     "afib BACKGROUND: The AFFIRM Study showed that treatment of
                 patients with atrial fibrillation and a high risk for
                 stroke or death with a rhythm-control strategy offered
                 no survival advantage over a rate-control strategy in
                 an intention-to-treat analysis. This article reports an
                 on-treatment analysis of the relationship of survival
                 to cardiac rhythm and treatment as they changed over
                 time. METHODS AND RESULTS: Modeling techniques were
                 used to determine the relationships among survival,
                 baseline clinical variables, and time-dependent
                 variables. The following baseline variables were
                 significantly associated with an increased risk of
                 death: increasing age, coronary artery disease,
                 congestive heart failure, diabetes, stroke or transient
                 ischemic attack, smoking, left ventricular dysfunction,
                 and mitral regurgitation. Among the time-dependent
                 variables, the presence of sinus rhythm (SR) was
                 associated with a lower risk of death, as was warfarin
                 use. Antiarrhythmic drugs (AADs) were associated with
                 increased mortality only after adjustment for the
                 presence of SR. Consistent with the original
                 intention-to-treat analysis, AADs were no longer
                 associated with mortality when SR was removed from the
                 model. CONCLUSIONS: Warfarin use improves survival. SR
                 is either an important determinant of survival or a
                 marker for other factors associated with survival that
                 were not recorded, determined, or included in the
                 survival model. Currently available AADs are not
                 associated with improved survival, which suggests that
                 any beneficial antiarrhythmic effects of AADs are
                 offset by their adverse effects. If an effective method
                 for maintaining SR with fewer adverse effects were
                 available, it might be beneficial.",

                 information and their associated clinical information.
                 This information is shared with the worldwide scientific

                 resources available in this initiative following 3
                 components: data, expertise, and tools. The data available
                 in the Telemetric and Holter ECG Warehouse (THEW) includes
                 continuous electrocardiogram signals and associated
                 clinical information. The initiative attracted various
                 academic and private partners whom expertise covers a
                 large list of research arenas related to quantitative
                 electrocardiography; their contribution to the THEW
                 promotes cross-fertilization of scientific knowledge,
                 resources, and ideas that will advance the field of
                 quantitative electrocardiography. Finally, the tools of
                 the THEW include software and servers to access and review
                 the data available in the repository. To conclude, the
                 THEW is an initiative developed to benefit the scientific
                 community and to advance the field of quantitative
                 electrocardiography and cardiac safety. It is a new

                 as Physionet, the American Heart Association - Beth Israel
                 Hospital (AHA-BIH) arrhythmia database, and the Common

                 and costs attributable to treating atrial fibrillation
                 (AF) in the United States. METHODS: Retrospective
                 analyses of three federally funded US databases (2001
                 data): 1) hospital inpatient stays (the Healthcare Cost
                 and Utilization Project [HCUP]); 2) physician office
                 visits (the National Ambulatory Medical Care Survey
                 [NAMCS]); and 3) emergency department (ED) and hospital
                 outpatient department visits (OPD) (the National
                 Hospital Ambulatory Medical Care Survey [NHAMCS]).
                 Identification of AF medical encounters was based on
                 occurrence of AF-specific International Classification
                 of Diseases (9th Edition)--Clinical Modification
                 (ICD-9-CM) diagnosis code 427.31 (principal discharge
                 diagnosis for inpatient setting; any diagnosis field
                 for other settings). For the 10 most common principal
                 discharge diagnoses in the inpatient setting,
                 case-control comparison analyses were performed to
                 estimate annual incremental costs of AF as a comorbid
                 discharge diagnosis for hospital stays. Regression
                 models were used to assess the impact of AF on
                 hospitalization costs. Costs were estimated in year
                 2005 US dollars. RESULTS: Approximately 350,000
                 hospitalizations, 5.0 million office visits, 276,000 ED
                 visits, and 234,000 OPD were attributable to AF
                 annually within the United States. Total annual costs
                 for treatment of AF were estimated at \$6.65 billion,
                 including \$2.93 billion (44\%) for hospitalizations
                 with a principal discharge diagnosis of AF, \$1.95
                 billion (29\%) for the incremental inpatient cost of AF
                 as a comorbid diagnosis, \$1.53 billion (23\%) for
                 outpatient treatment of AF, and \$235 million (4\%) for
                 prescription drugs. In all regressions, AF was a
                 significant contributor to hospital cost. CONCLUSIONS:
                 Treatment of AF represents a significant health-care
                 burden with the costs of treating AF in the inpatient
                 setting outweighing the costs of treating AF in the
                 office, emergency room or hospital outpatient settings.
                 Further research is needed to fully capture the costs
                 of treating AF.",

  abstract =     "afib Chronic atrial fibrillation (AF) occurs often in the
                 setting of mitral and aortic valve disease. Eventually,
                 these patients undergo valve replacement which improves
                 cardiac function but does not prevent AF. This study
                 investigates which patient may benefit from additional
                 surgery for the cure of AF performed in combination
                 with valve surgery. Seventy-four patients were
                 retrospectively included from our prospective database
                 of patients referred for serial cardioversion therapy
                 between 1986 and 1993. All these patients had chronic
                 AF after valve replacement. After the first electrical
                 cardioversion, patients did not receive antiarrhythmic
                 drugs. Relapses were managed by repeated
                 cardioversions, and then antiarrhythmic drugs were
                 instituted. After a median follow-up of 7 years (range
                 1.3 to 23), 39 patients had intractable AF.
                 Multivariate analysis revealed that patients with a
                 history of chronic AF before surgery (risk ratio 5.4,
                 confidence intervals 2.5 to 11.3, p = 0.0001) had a
                 poor arrhythmia outcome. In addition, Kaplan-Meier
                 survival analysis demonstrated a lower success rate (p
                 = 0.0017) in patients with mitral valve disease than in
                 those with aortic valve disease. Congestive heart
                 failure (41\% vs 6\%, p = 0.0007) and cardiovascular
                 mortality (23\% vs 9\%, p = 0.09) were seen most often
                 in patients with an unsuccessful cardioversion
                 strategy. Thus, patients scheduled for mitral valve
                 surgery with a history of chronic AF should be
                 considered candidates for additional surgery for AF
                 concomitantly performed during valve surgery.",

                 continuous biatrial epicardial activation sequences of AF
                 in humans using noninvasive electrocardiographic imaging
                 (ECGI). In the testing phase, ECGI
                 accuracy was evaluated by comparing ECGI with
                 co-registered CARTO images during atrial pacing in 6
                 patients. Additionally, correlative observations from
                 catheter mapping and ablation were compared with ECGI in 3
                 patients. In the study phase, ECGI maps during AF in 26
                 patients were analyzed for mechanisms and complexity. ECGI
                 noninvasively imaged the low-amplitude signals of AF in a
                 wide range of patients (97 procedural success). Spatial
                 accuracy for determining initiation sites from pacing was
                 6 mm. Locations critical to maintenance of AF identified
                 during catheter ablation were identified by ECGI; ablation
                 near these sites restored sinus rhythm. In the study
                 phase, the most common patterns of AF were multiple
                 wavelets (92), with pulmonary vein (69) and non-pulmonary
                 vein (62) focal sites. Rotor activity was seen rarely
                 (15). AF complexity increased with longer clinical history
                 of AF, although the degree of complexity of nonparoxysmal
                 AF varied widely. CONCLUSIONS: ECGI offers a noninvasive
                 way to map epicardial activation patterns of AF in a
                 patient-specific manner. The results highlight the
                 coexistence of a variety of mechanisms and variable
                 complexity among patients. Overall, complexity generally
                 increased with duration of AF.",

                 noninvasive functional EP 
                 imaging modality, was performed during sinus rhythm (SR)
                 in 24 subjects with infarct-related myocardial scar. The
                 abnormal EP substrate on the epicardial aspect of the scar
                 was identified, and its location, size, and morphology
                 were compared with the anatomic scar imaged by other
                 noninvasive modalities. RESULTS: Electrocardiographic
                 imaging constructs epicardial electrograms that have
                 characteristics of reduced amplitude (low voltage) and
                 fractionation. Electrocardiographic imaging colocalizes
                 the epicardial electrical scar to the anatomic scar with a
                 high degree of accuracy (sensitivity 89\%, specificity
                 85\%). In nearly all subjects, SR activation patterns were
                 affected by the presence of myocardial scar. Late
                 potentials could be identified and were almost always
                 within ventricular scar. CONCLUSIONS: Electrocardiographic
                 imaging accurately identifies areas of anatomic scar and
                 complements standard anatomic imaging by providing
                 scar-related EP characteristics of low voltages, altered
                 SR activation, electrogram fragmentation, and presence of
                 late potentials.",

                 decade, catheter ablation has provided an improvement in

                 long-term healthcare costs and avoiding recurrences

                 cardiovascular MRI is a well-established tool to image the
                 myocardium and, most specifically, the left atrium. Unique

                 frequency band of interest. The widely used sLORETA
                 algorithm was adapted for STR and generally used for
                 source reconstruction. STR and filtering approaches were
                 evaluated with respect to spatial localization error and
                 spatial dispersion, as well as to correlation of original
                 and reconstructed source time courses in single source and
                 two source scenarios with fixed source locations and
                 oscillating source waveforms. We used extensive computer
                 simulations and tested all algorithms with different
                 parameter settings (noise levels and regularization
                 parameters) for EEG data. To verify our results, we also
                 used data from MEG phantom measurements. For the
                 investigated scenarios, we did not find any evidence that
                 STR-based methods outperform purely spatial algorithms
                 applied to temporally filtered data. Furthermore, the
                 results show very clearly that the performance of STR
                 depends very much on the choice of regularization
                 parameters.",

                 neurogenic tissue led us to hypothesize that removal of
                 the aortic fat pad could cause an autonomic imbalance
                 and contribute to atrial arrhythmias following cardiac
                 surgery. METHODS: 131 patients underwent conventional
                 cardio-pulmonary bypass surgery (CPB) or off pump
                 coronary bypass surgery (OPCAB). The fat pad was either
                 left intact or removed. The incidence of de novo atrial
                 arrhythmias during the patient's hospital stay was
                 tabulated. After promising preliminary results, an
                 extension study (n =189 patients, total patients =320)
                 was performed which employed the same definitions and
                 interventions but was a sample of convenience. The data
                 of this second study have not been previously
                 published. RESULTS: In the pilot study, in
                 demographically similar groups, logistic regression
                 demonstrated a significantly elevated atrial arrhythmia
                 incidence when the fat pad was removed (Odds ratio
                 3.49, 95\% confidence intervals 1.09 to 11.18). A
                 chi-square analysis of these same data, however, (4
                 fibrillations in 58 patients with fat pad intact versus
                 15 fibrillation in 73 patients with fat pad removed; P
                 = 0.051) suggested that the importance of the fat pad
                 status was not definite. Overall, atrial arrhythmias
                 were present in 19 of 131 patients (14.5\%). In the
                 extension study, in contrast to the pilot data, the
                 data did not demonstrate any contribution of fat pad
                 status to the incidence of atrial fibrillation.
                 CONCLUSIONS: Although we feel that our hypothesis
                 remains viable, retention of the aortic fat pad during
                 coronary artery bypass surgery may not be related to a
                 decreased incidence of post operative atrial
                 arrhythmias.",

                 Nonsurgical subxyphoid pericardial access was achieved
                 in 10 normal goats and 7 pigs with healed myocardial
                 infarctions. A 4-mm cooled-tip RF ablation catheter
                 (continuous 0.9\% saline circulation at 0.6 mL/s; goal
                 temperature, 40 C; 60 seconds) was used to deliver
                 epicardial ventricular lesions: 47 in normal tissue and
                 22 in infarcted tissue. Standard RF ablation lesions
                 (n=33) using a 4-mm top catheter (goal temperature, 70
                 C; 60 seconds) were also placed on normal epicardial
                 tissue. Lesions created with standard and cooled-tip RF
                 ablation were 3.7+/-1.3 mm (25+/-16.8 W) and 6.7+/-1.7
                 mm (44.8+/-6.8 W) in depth, respectively. On scar
                 tissue, lesions made with the cooled-tip catheter
                 measured 14.6+/-2.7 mm in length, 11.8+/-2.9 mm in
                 width, and 5.6+/-1.2 mm in depth (35.6+/-7.1 W). In
                 areas covered by epicardial fat (3.1+/-1.2 mm thick),
                 standard RF energy did not generate any appreciable
                 lesions, but cooled-tip RF lesions were 4.1+/-2 mm in
                 depth (45+/-4.4 W). Conclusions: Cooled-tip RF ablation
                 can generate epicardial lesions more effectively than
                 standard RF ablation and appears to be of particular
                 benefit in ablating areas with overlying epicardial

                 fraction (LVEF) >35\% using a personalized virtual heart
                 simulation approach. METHODS AND RESULTS: A total of four
                 contrast enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)
                 datasets of patient hearts with MI and average LVEF of
                 44.0 +/- 2.6\% were used in this study. Because of the
                 preserved LVEF, the patients were not indicated for
                 implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) insertion.
                 One patient had spontaneous ventricular tachycardia (VT)
                 prior to the MRI scan; the others had no arrhythmic
                 events. Simulations of arrhythmia susceptibility were
                 blind to clinical outcome. Models were constructed from
                 patient MRI images segmented to identify myocardium, grey
                 zone, and scar based on pixel intensity. Grey zone was
                 modelled as having altered electrophysiology. Programmed
                 electrical stimulation (PES) was performed to assess VT
                 inducibility from 19 bi-ventricular sites in each heart
                 model. Simulations successfully predicted arrhythmia risk
                 in all four patients. For the patient with arrhythmic
                 event, in-silico PES resulted in VT induction. Simulations
                 correctly predicted that VT was non-inducible for the
                 three patients with no recorded VT events. CONCLUSIONS:
                 Results demonstrate that the personalized virtual heart
                 simulation approach may provide a novel risk
                 stratification modality to non-invasively and effectively
                 identify patients with LVEF >35\% who could benefit from

                 electro-physiological (EP) model, it is important to
                 estimate the 3-D distributed tissue properties of the
                 myocardium. Ideally, the tissue property should be
                 estimated at the resolution of the cardiac mesh. However,
                 such high-dimensional estimation faces major challenges in
                 identifiability and computation. Most existing works
                 reduce this dimension by partitioning the cardiac mesh
                 into a pre-defined set of segments. The resulting
                 low-resolution solutions have a limited ability to
                 represent the underlying heterogeneous tissue properties
                 of varying sizes, locations, and distributions. In this
                 paper, we present a novel framework that, going beyond a
                 uniform low-resolution approach, is able to obtain a
                 higher resolution estimation of tissue properties
                 represented by spatially non-uniform resolution. This is
                 achieved by two central elements: 1) a multi-scale
                 coarse-to-fine optimization that facilitates higher
                 resolution optimization using the lower resolution
                 solution and 2) a spatially adaptive decision criterion
                 that retains lower resolution in homogeneous tissue
                 regions and allows higher resolution in heterogeneous
                 tissue regions. The presented framework is evaluated in
                 estimating the local tissue excitability properties of a
                 cardiac EP model on both synthetic and real data
                 experiments. Its performance is compared with optimization
                 using pre-defined segments. Results demonstrate the
                 feasibility of the presented framework to estimate local
                 parameters and to reveal heterogeneous tissue properties
                 at a higher resolution without using a high number of
                 unknowns.",

                 of integrated electroanatomic mapping with preacquired
                 magnetic resonance/computed tomographic (MR/CT) images
                 to guide catheter ablation of atrial fibrillation (AF)
                 in a series of patients. METHODS AND RESULTS: Sixteen
                 consecutive patients with drug-refractory AF underwent
                 catheter ablation under the guidance of a
                 three-dimensional (3D) electroanatomic mapping system
                 (Carto, Biosense Webster, Inc., Diamond Bar, CA, USA).
                 Gadolinium-enhanced MR (n = 8) or contrast-enhanced
                 high-resolution CT (n = 8) imaging was performed within
                 1 day prior to the ablation procedures. Using a novel
                 software package (CartoMerge, Biosense Webster, Inc.),
                 the left atrium (LA) with pulmonary veins (PVs) was
                 segmented and extracted for image registration. The
                 segmented 3D MR/CT LA reconstruction was accurately
                 registered to the real-time mapping space with a
                 combination of landmark registration and surface
                 registration. The registered 3D MR/CT LA reconstruction
                 was successfully used to guide deployment of RF
                 applications encircling the PVs. Upon completion of the
                 circumferential lesions around the PVs, 32\% of the PVs
                 were electrically isolated. Guided by a circular
                 mapping catheter, the remaining PVs were disconnected
                 from the LA using a segmental approach. The distance
                 between the surface of the registered 3D MR/CT LA
                 reconstruction and multiple electroanatomic map points
                 was 3.05 +/- 0.41 mm. No complications were observed.
                 CONCLUSIONS: Three-dimensional MR/CT images can be
                 successfully extracted and registered to anatomically
                 guided clinical AF ablations. The display of detailed
                 and accurate anatomic information during the procedure
                 enables tailored RF ablation to individual PV and LA

                 the epicardial surface of each cardiac chamber in 9
                 mongrel dogs. Detailed 3D cardiac anatomy was
                 reconstructed from contrast-enhanced, high-resolution
                 CT images and registered to the electroanatomic maps of
                 each cardiac chamber. To assess accuracy, targeted
                 ablations were performed at each of the fiducial
                 markers guided only by the reconstructed 3D images. At
                 autopsy, the position error was 1.9+/-0.9 mm for the
                 right atrium, 2.7+/-1.2 mm for the right ventricle,
                 1.8+/-1.0 mm for the left atrium, and 2.3+/-1.1 mm for
                 the left ventricle. To evaluate the system's guidance
                 of more complex clinical ablation strategies, ablations
                 of the cavotricuspid isthmus (n=4), fossa ovalis (n=4),
                 and pulmonary veins (n=6) were performed, which
                 resulted in position errors of 1.8+/-1.5, 2.2+/-1.3,
                 and 2.1+/-1.2 mm, respectively. Retrospective analysis
                 revealed that a combination of landmark registration
                 and the target chamber surface registration resulted in
                 <3 mm accuracy in all 4 cardiac chambers. CONCLUSIONS:
                 Image integration with high-resolution 3D CT allows
                 accurate placement of anatomically guided ablation
                 lesions and can facilitate complex ablation strategies.
                 This may provide significant advantages for
                 anatomically based procedures such as ablation of
                 atrial fibrillation and nonidiopathic ventricular
                 tachycardia.",

                 baseline and 6 mo to evaluate left ventricular (LV)
                 ejection fraction (EF). Dogs were given metoprolol (50-100
                 mg po bid) and digoxin (0.0625-0.125 mg po bid) to limit
                 the ventricular response rate to <180 beats/min and to
                 mitigate the effects of heart failure. The pacing leads in
                 pigs became entirely encapsulated and lost the ability to
                 excite the heart, often before the onset of sustained AF.
                 LV EF in dogs dropped from 54 +/- 11\% at baseline to 33
                 +/- 7\% at 6 mo (P < 0.05), whereas LV EF in goats did not

                 Positional ST-segment changes during continuous,
                 multi-lead electrocardiographic (ECG) monitoring are
                 particularly challenging to distinguish from transient

                 are often not feasible to record at the beginning of
                 monitoring in unstable patients; 2) positional ECG
                 templates, if recorded, are often not readily
                 accessible to clinicians for later comparison; 3) body
                 position cannot be correlated with ST events because
                 patients are out of the direct view of nurses during
                 the event or clinicians review ST trends at a later
                 time; 4) ST monitors typically do not store ECGs
                 frequently enough to be able to observe on the ST trend
                 the gradual (ramp-like) onset of ST changes that is
                 characteristic of transient ischemia; and 5) absence of
                 chest pain with a ST event does not help clinicians
                 identify false alarms because it is well understood

                 guidelines for optimal ST-segment monitoring.
                 CONCLUSIONS: Because changes in the ST segment can
                 shift among various electrocardiographic leads in the
                 same person over time owing to different ischemic
                 mechanisms, 12-lead ST monitoring is recommended.
                 Recommended monitoring times are as follows: myocardial
                 infarction or unstable angina, 24 to 48 hours or until
                 patient is event-free for 12 to 24 hours; chest pain
                 prompting a visit to an emergency department, 8 to 12
                 hours; catheter-based interventions with less
                 definitive interventional outcomes requiring monitoring
                 in an intensive unit, 6 to 12 hours; and cardiac
                 surgery or noncardiac surgery in patients with coronary
                 disease or risk factors, 24 to 48 hours. An ST
                 measurement point of J + 60 ms makes it unlikely that
                 measurement will coincide with the upslope of the T
                 wave, even in patients with sinus tachycardia. Accurate
                 and consistent lead placement and careful electrode and
                 skin preparation are imperative to improve the clinical
                 usefulness of ST monitoring.",

                 body surface potential maps, recorded during
                 percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty
                 protocols, using a realistic geometry computer heart
                 model. Other objectives were to address the question of
                 reciprocal ST-segment changes observed in the 12-lead
                 electrocardiogram during ischemia and to verify the
                 hypothesis that the shortening of the QRS duration
                 observed in left anterior descending (LAD) coronary
                 artery occlusion may be explained by conduction delay
                 in the septal His-Purkinje system. Simulation was
                 achieved by first introducing into the heart model
                 three transmural zones of mild, moderate, and severe
                 ischemia for assumed occlusions in the LAD, left
                 circumflex, and right coronary arteries. The heart
                 model was then excited, in turn, with these three zones
                 present for assumed occlusions in the LAD, left
                 circumflex, and right coronary arteries. Myocardial
                 conduction velocities in the regions of moderate and
                 severe ischemia were assumed to be reduced to 75 and
                 50\% of normal, respectively. Model action potentials
                 in the mild, moderate, and severely ischemic zones were
                 also altered to reflect known ischemic changes in these
                 action potentials. Body surface potential maps and
                 electrocardiograms were computed by placing the heart
                 inside a numerical torso model. Simulated map patterns
                 during both ST-segment and QRS were qualitatively
                 similar to clinical maps. Reciprocal ST-segment
                 depression was observed for all three occlusions in
                 remote leads that did not overlie the ischemic zones.
                 QRS shortening due to septal His-Purkinje conduction
                 delay was verified. The simulation results attest to
                 the model's ability to reproduce body surface potential
                 distributions recorded following percutaneous
                 transluminal coronary angioplasty protocols. The
                 simulations also showed that reciprocal ST-segment
                 changes occur as a natural consequence of the primary
                 ischemic region and that there is no need to invoke a
                 second region of ischemia. Finally, the model
                 demonstrated that QRS shortening can occur in LAD
                 occlusion despite a slowing of conduction down the
                 septal His-Purkinje system.",

                 aspect of brain activity. This activity is not measured
                 directly but recorded as electrical potential changes
                 using head surface electrodes (electroencephalogram -
                 EEG). Head surface electrodes can also be deployed to
                 inject electrical currents in order to modulate brain
                 activity (transcranial electric stimulation techniques)
                 for therapeutic and neuroscientific purposes. In
                 electroencephalography and noninvasive electric brain
                 stimulation, electrical fields mediate between electrical
                 signal sources and regions of interest (ROI). These fields
                 can be very complicated in structure, and are influenced
                 in a complex way by the conductivity profile of the human
                 head. Visualization techniques play a central role to
                 grasp the nature of those fields because such techniques
                 allow for an effective conveyance of complex data and
                 enable quick qualitative and quantitative assessments. The
                 examination of volume conduction effects of particular
                 head model parameterizations (e.g., skull thickness and
                 layering), of brain anomalies (e.g., holes in the skull,
                 tumors), location and extent of active brain areas (e.g.,
                 high concentrations of current densities) and around
                 current injecting electrodes can be investigated using
                 visualization. Here, we evaluate a number of widely used
                 visualization techniques, based on either the potential
                 distribution or on the current-flow. In particular, we
                 focus on the extractability of quantitative and
                 qualitative information from the obtained images, their
                 effective integration of anatomical context information,
                 and their interaction. We present illustrative examples

                 electrograms met these criteria for the first 20
                 minutes of no-flow ischemia. Thereafter, the percentage

                 initial preclinical experience with real-time magnetic
                 resonance (MR) imaging-guided atrial septal puncture by
                 using a MR imaging-conspicuous blunt laser catheter that
                 perforates only when energized. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The
                 authors customized a 0.9-mm clinical excimer laser
                 catheter with a receiver coil to impart MR imaging
                 visibility at 1.5 T. Seven swine underwent laser
                 transseptal puncture under real-time MR imaging. MR
                 imaging signal-to-noise ratio profiles of the device were
                 obtained in vitro. Tissue traversal force was tested with
                 a calibrated meter. Position was corroborated with
                 pressure measurements, oximetry, angiography, and
                 necropsy. Intentional non-target perforation simulated
                 serious complication. RESULTS: Embedded MR imaging
                 antennae accurately reflected the position of the laser
                 catheter tip and profile in vitro and in vivo.
		  MR imaging-guided
                 laser puncture of the interatrial septum is feasible in
                 swine and offers controlled delivery of perforation energy
                 by using an otherwise blunt catheter. Instantaneous soft
                 tissue imaging provides immediate feedback on safety.",

                 flutter often coexist. The long-term occurrence of
                 atrial fibrillation in patients presenting with atrial
                 flutter alone is unknown. We report the long-term
                 follow-up in patients who underwent cavotricuspid
                 isthmus ablation for treatment of lone atrial flutter.
                 Methods and Results: Between January 1997 and June
                 2002, 632 patients underwent cavotricuspid isthmus
                 ablation for the treatment of typical atrial flutter at
                 the Cleveland Clinic Foundation. Three hundred
                 sixty-three patients were included in this study and
                 followed for a mean duration of 39 +/- 11 months. The
                 mean duration of atrial flutter symptoms was 12 +/- 5
                 months. Mean left-atrial size and left-ventricular
                 ejection fraction were 4.2 +/- 0.8 cm and 47 +/- 13\%,
                 respectively. After a mean follow-up time of 39 +/- 11
                 months, 13\% (48 of 363) of the patients remained in
                 sinus rhythm. Five percent (18 of 363) of patients
                 experienced recurrence of atrial flutter only.
                 Sixty-eight percent (246 of 363) experienced the onset
                 of atrial fibrillation and 14\% (51 of 363) experienced
                 recurrence of atrial flutter and the new onset of
                 atrial fibrillation. Overall, 82\% (297 of 363) of the
                 patients experienced new onset of drug refractory
                 atrial fibrillation. Left-atrial size was a predictor
                 of atrial fibrillation recurrence post-atrial flutter
                 ablation. Conclusion: At long-term follow-up,
                 approximately 82\% of patients post-cavotricuspid
                 isthmus ablation for atrial flutter developed drug
                 refractory atrial fibrillation. This finding suggests
                 that elimination of atrial flutter might delay, but
                 does not prevent, atrial fibrillation. Evidence
                 suggests both arrhythmias may share common triggers and
                 such patients may derive a better long-term benefit
                 from anatomical ablative treatment of atrial
                 fibrillation as well.",

                 of some degree of physiological realism of the solution
                 set, and that this relaxation can be used as a framework
                 to study model inaccuracy and solution uncertainty. We
                 present two examples, one using data from a healthy human
                 subject and the other synthesized with the ECGSIM software
                 package. In the first case, we consider uncertainty in the
                 initial guess and regularization parameter. In the second
                 case, we mimic the presence of an ischemic zone in the
                 heart in a way which violates a model assumption. We show
                 that the convex relaxation allows understanding of spatial
                 distribution of parameter sensitivity in the first case,
                 and identification of model violation in the second.",

                 address two of these impediments: the difficulty of
                 reconstructing electric potentials on the inner
                 (endocardial) as well as outer (epicardial) surfaces of
                 the ventricles, and the need for full anatomical imaging
                 of the subject's thorax to build an accurate
                 subject-specific geometry. We introduce two new features
                 in our reconstruction algorithm: a nonlinear low-order
                 dynamic parameterization derived from the measured body
                 surface signals, and a technique to jointly regularize
                 both surfaces. With these methodological innovations in
                 combination, it is possible to reconstruct endocardial
                 activation from clinically acquired measurements with an
                 imprecise thorax geometry. In particular we test the
                 method using body surface potentials acquired from three
                 subjects during clinical procedures where the subjects'
                 hearts were paced on their endocardia using a catheter
                 device. Our geometric models were constructed using a set
                 of CT scans limited in axial extent to the immediate
                 region near the heart. The catheter system provides a
                 reference location to which we compare our results. We
                 compare our estimates of pacing site localization, in
                 terms of both accuracy and stability, to those reported in
                 a recent clinical publication , where a full set of CT

                 classification (RAP-MUSIC) algorithm. In this method
                 the signal subspace of the Task data is projected
                 against the orthogonal complement of the Control data
                 signal subspace to obtain a subspace which describes
                 spatial activity unique to the Task. A RAP-MUSIC
                 localization search is then performed on this projected
                 data to localize the sources which are active in the
                 Task but not in the Control data. In addition to
                 dipolar sources, effective blocking of more complex
                 sources, e.g., multiple synchronously activated dipoles
                 or synchronously activated distributed source activity,
                 is possible since these topographies are well-described
                 by the Control data signal subspace. Unlike previously

                 effective in situations where the time series
                 associated with Control and Task activity possess
                 significant cross correlation. The method also allows
                 for straightforward determination of the estimated time
                 series of the localized target sources. A multiepoch
                 MEG simulation and a phantom experiment are presented

  abstract =     "afib Atrial conduction properties have been shown to differ
                 among animal atrial fibrillation (AF) models of rapid
                 atrial pacing (RAP), chronic mitral regurgitation (MR),
                 and control. We hypothesized that these conduction
                 differences would continue with the onset of AF, which
                 would affect AF spatiotemporal organization, resulting
                 in model-specific characteristics of AF. With frequency
                 domain analysis of electrograms acquired from
                 high-density optical mapping, AF from the right (RA)
                 and left (LA) atrium in animals with RAP and MR were
                 compared with control animals. At follow-up, the hearts
                 were excised and perfused, and optical action
                 potentials were recorded from a 2 x 2-cm area each of
                 the RA and LA free wall with a 16 x 16 photodiode
                 array. AF was induced with extra stimuli, several 2.4-s
                 AF episodes were recorded in each dog, and a fast
                 Fourier transform was calculated. The dominant
                 frequency (DF) was determined, and the organization
                 (organization index, OI) was calculated as the ratio of
                 the area under the dominant peak and its harmonics to
                 the total area of the spectrum. All possible pairs of
                 electrograms for each episode were cross-correlated. LA
                 AF in the chronic MR model showed an increase in the
                 highest DF, the number of DF domains, and in frequency
                 gradient compared with AF in control or RAP models. In
                 addition, there was a decrease in OI and in the
                 correlation coefficients in the LA of the MR model.
                 These results suggest that the AF substrate in the MR
                 model may be different from that of control or RAP

                 been developed that demonstrate either atrial
                 structural remodeling or atrial electrical remodeling,
                 but the characteristics and spatiotemporal organization
                 of the AF between the models have not been compared.
                 Thirty-nine dogs were divided into five groups: rapid
                 atrial pacing (RAP), chronic mitral regurgitation (MR),
                 congestive heart failure (CHF), methylcholine (Meth),
                 and control. Right and left atria (RA and LA,
                 respectively) were simultaneously mapped during
                 episodes of AF in each animal using high-density (240
                 electrodes) epicardial arrays. Multiple 30-s AF epochs
                 were recorded in each dog. Fast Fourier transform was
                 calculated every 1 s over a sliding 2-s window, and
                 dominant frequency (DF) was determined. Stable,
                 discrete, high-frequency areas were seen in none of the
                 RAP or control dogs, four of nine MR dogs, four of six
                 CHF dogs, and seven of nine Meth dogs in either the RA
                 or LA or both. Average DFs in the Meth model were
                 significantly greater than in all other models in both
                 LA and RA except LA DFs in the RAP model. The RAP model
                 was the only one with a consistent LA-to-RA DF gradient
                 (9.5 +/- 0.2 vs. 8.3 +/- 0.3 Hz, P < 0.00005). The Meth
                 model had a higher spatial and temporal variance of DFs
                 and lower measured organization levels compared with
                 the other AF models, and it was the only model to show
                 a linear relationship between the highest DF and
                 dispersion (R(2) = 0.86). These data indicate that
                 structural remodeling of atria (models known to have
                 predominantly altered conduction) leads to an AF
                 characterized by a stable high-frequency area, whereas
                 electrical remodeling of atria (models known to have
                 predominantly shortened refractoriness without
                 significant conduction abnormalities) leads to an AF
                 characterized by multiple high-frequency areas and
                 multiple wavelets.",

                 radiofrequency (RF) ablation catheter ablation for atrial
                 fibrillation (AF) were recruited for this study from three
                 different centers. Cardiac computerized tomography (CT)
                 was performed in all patients and a 3D image of the left
                 atrium (LA) and pulmonary veins (PVs) was extracted for
                 registration after segmentation using a software program
                 (CartoMerge, Biosense Webster, Inc.). Different landmarks
                 were selected for registration and compared. Surface
                 registration was then done and the impact on integration
                 and the landmarks was evaluated. The best landmark
                 registration was achieved when the posterior points on the
                 pulmonary veins were selected (5.6 +/- 3.2). Landmarks
                 taken on the anterior wall, left atrial appendage (LAA) or
                 the coronary sinus (CS) resulted in a larger registration
                 error (9.1 +/- 2.5). The mean error for surface
                 registration was 2.17 +/- 1.65. However, surface
                 registration resulted in shifting of the initially
                 registered landmark points leading to a larger error (from
                 5.6 +/- 3.2 to 9.2 +/- 2.1; 95\% CI 4.2-3.05). CONCLUSION:
                 Posterior wall landmarks at the PV-LA junction are the
                 most accurate landmarks for image integration in respect
                 to the target ablation area. The concurrent use of the
                 present surface registration algorithm may result in
                 shifting of the initial landmarks with loss of their
                 initial correlation with the area of interest.",

                 the potentials at the remaining electrodes of a
                 dense-array electroencephalography net. We first derive
                 analytic expressions for the potentials generated by
                 scalp current injection in a four-sphere model of the
                 human head. We then use a multistart downhill simplex
                 algorithm to find regional tissue conductivities which
                 minimize the error between measured and computed scalp
                 potentials. Two error functions are studied, with
                 similar results. The results show that, despite the low
                 skull conductivity and expected shunting by the scalp,
                 all four regional conductivities can be determined to
                 within a few percent error. The method is robust to the
                 noise levels expected in practice. To obtain accurate
                 results the cerebrospinal fluid must be included in the

                 electroencephalographic (EEG) electrodes creates the
                 risk of infection from blood-born pathogens such as
                 HIV, Hepatitis-C, and Creutzfeldt-Jacob Disease. Modern
                 engineering principles suggest that excellent EEG
                 signals can be collected with high scalp impedance (
                 approximately 40 kOmega) without scalp abrasion. The
                 present study was designed to evaluate the effect of
                 electrode-scalp impedance on EEG data quality. METHODS:
                 The first section of the paper reviews
                 electrophysiological recording with modern high
                 input-impedance differential amplifiers and subject
                 isolation, and explains how scalp-electrode impedance
                 influences EEG signal amplitude and power line noise.
                 The second section of the paper presents an
                 experimental study of EEG data quality as a function of
                 scalp-electrode impedance for the standard frequency
                 bands in EEG and event-related potential (ERP)
                 recordings and for 60 Hz noise. RESULTS: There was no
                 significant amplitude change in any EEG frequency bands
                 as scalp-electrode impedance increased from less than
                 10 kOmega (abraded skin) to 40 kOmega (intact skin). 60
                 Hz was nearly independent of impedance mismatch,
                 suggesting that capacitively coupled noise appearing
                 differentially across mismatched electrode impedances
                 did not contribute substantially to the observed 60 Hz
                 noise levels. CONCLUSIONS: With modern high
                 input-impedance amplifiers and accurate digital filters
                 for power line noise, high-quality EEG can be recorded
                 without skin abrasion.",

                 identify patterns and features associated with
                 arrhythmias. In order to quantitatively compare these two
                 visualization methods, eight cardiologists were asked to
                 complete forced-choice tasks in which they selected
                 ablation sites based on synthetic vector or isochronal
                 maps. Maps varied in arrhythmia complexity, number of

                 magnitude or angle for maps of velocity vectors.
                 Quantitative comparison was achieved by using psychometric

                 was no significant difference in performance between

                 vector mapping has been proposed as an alternative method
                 to study cardiac activation in both clinical and research
                 environments. In addition to the visual cues that vector
                 maps can provide, vector fields can be analyzed using
                 mathematical operators such as the divergence and curl. In
                 the current study, conduction features were extracted from
                 velocity vector fields computed from cardiac mapping data.
                 The divergence was used to locate ectopic foci and
                 wavefront collisions, and the curl to identify central
                 obstacles in reentrant circuits. Both operators were
                 applied to simulated rhythms created from a
                 two-dimensional cellular automaton model, to measured data
                 from an in situ experimental canine model, and to complex
                 three-dimensional human cardiac mapping data sets.
                 Analysis of simulated vector fields indicated that the
                 divergence is useful in identifying ectopic foci, with a
                 relatively small number of vectors and with errors of up
                 to 30 degrees in the angle measurements. The curl was
                 useful for identifying central obstacles in reentrant
                 circuits, and the number of velocity vectors needed
                 increased as the rhythm became more complex. The
                 divergence was able to accurately identify canine in situ
                 pacing sites, areas of breakthrough activation, and
                 wavefront collisions. In data from human arrhythmias, the
                 divergence reliably estimated origins of electrical
                 activity and wavefront collisions, but the curl was less
                 reliable at locating central obstacles in reentrant
                 circuits, possibly due to the retrospective nature of data
                 collection. ",

                 cardiac T1 mapping pulse sequence for quantification of
                 diffuse fibrosis. METHODS: An arrhythmia-insensitive
                 cardiac T1 mapping pulse sequence was developed based on
                 saturation recovery T1 weighting, which is inherently
                 insensitive to heart rate and rhythm, and two single-shot
                 balanced steady-state free precession image acquisitions
                 with centric k-space ordering, where T1 calculation is
                 inherently insensitive to T2 effects. Its performance
                 against conventional cardiac T1 mapping based on inversion
                 recovery (i.e., MOLLI) is compared. Phantom experiments
                 (T1 ranging from 535 to 2123 ms) were performed with heart
                 rate and rhythm simulated at 60 and 120 beats per minute
                 (bpm) and arrhythmia using an external triggering device.
                 Ten human subjects and 17 large animals were scanned
                 precontrast and 5, 10, and 15 min after contrast agent
                 administration. RESULTS: Compared with the reference T1
                 mapping, AIR yielded lower normalized root-mean-square
                 error than MOLLI (8\% vs. 3\%, respectively, at 60 bpm,
                 28\% vs. 3\%, respectively, at 120 bpm, and 22\% vs. 3\%,
                 respectively, at arrhythmia). In vivo studies showed that
                 T1 measurements made by MOLLI and AIR were strongly
                 correlated (r = 0.99) but in poor agreement (mean
                 difference = 161.8 ms, upper and lower 95\% limits of
                 agreements = 347.5 ms and -24.0 ms). CONCLUSION: Our AIR

                 considered irreversible. Here, repetitive transorbital
                 alternating current stimulation (rtACS) was applied in
                 partially blind patients with the goal of activating their
                 residual vision. METHODS: We conducted a multicenter,
                 prospective, randomized, double-blind, sham-controlled
                 trial in an ambulatory setting with daily application of
                 rtACS (n = 45) or sham-stimulation (n = 37) for 50 min for
                 a duration of 10 week days. A volunteer sample of patients
                 with optic nerve damage (mean age 59.1 yrs) was recruited.
                 The primary outcome measure for efficacy was
                 super-threshold visual fields with 48 hrs after the last
                 treatment day and at 2-months follow-up. Secondary outcome
                 measures were near-threshold visual fields, reaction time,
                 visual acuity, and resting-state EEGs to assess changes in
                 brain physiology. RESULTS: The rtACS-treated group had a
                 mean improvement in visual field of 24.0\% which was
                 significantly greater than after sham-stimulation (2.5\%).
                 This improvement persisted for at least 2 months in terms
                 of both within- and between-group comparisons. Secondary
                 analyses revealed improvements of near-threshold visual
                 fields in the central 5 degrees and increased thresholds
                 in static perimetry after rtACS and improved reaction
                 times, but visual acuity did not change compared to shams.
                 Visual field improvement induced by rtACS was associated
                 with EEG power-spectra and coherence alterations in visual
                 cortical networks which are interpreted as signs of
                 neuromodulation. Current flow simulation indicates current
                 in the frontal cortex, eye, and optic nerve and in the
                 subcortical but not in the cortical regions. CONCLUSION:
                 rtACS treatment is a safe and effective means to partially
                 restore vision after optic nerve damage probably by
                 modulating brain plasticity. This class 1 evidence
                 suggests that visual fields can be improved in a
                 clinically meaningful way. TRIAL REGISTRATION:

                 sinoatrial node cells, as well as rabbit or human
                 atrial cells. These one-dimensional models were
                 implemented using CMISS on an SGI Origin 2000
                 supercomputer. Intercellular coupling parameters
                 recorded in experimental studies on sinoatrial node and
                 atrial cell-pairs under-represent the electrotonic
                 interactions that any cardiomyocyte would have in a
                 multidimensional setting. Multicellular one-dimensional
                 models of sinoatrial node and atrium require larger
                 than physiologic intercellular conductivities in order
                 to make up for a lack of anatomical spatial scaling.
                 Multicellular models for more in-depth quantitative
                 studies will require more realistic

                 used to acutely visualize radiofrequency ablation lesions,
                 but its accuracy in predicting chronic lesion size is
                 unknown. The main goal of this study was to characterize
                 different areas of enhancement in late gadolinium
                 enhancement MRI done immediately after ablation to predict
                 acute edema and chronic lesion size. METHODS AND RESULTS:
                 In a canine model (n=10), ventricular radiofrequency
                 lesions were created using ThermoCool SmartTouch (Biosense
                 Webster) catheter. All animals underwent MRI (late
                 gadolinium enhancement and T2-weighted edema imaging)
                 immediately after ablation and after 1, 2, 4, and 8 weeks.
                 Edema, microvascular obstruction, and enhanced volumes
                 were identified in MRI and normalized to chronic
                 histological volume. Immediately after contrast
                 administration, the microvascular obstruction region was
                 3.2+/-1.1 times larger than the chronic lesion volume in
                 acute MRI. Even 60 minutes after contrast administration,
                 edema was 8.7+/-3.31 times and the enhanced area
                 6.14+/-2.74 times the chronic lesion volume. Exponential
                 fit to the microvascular obstruction volume was found to
                 be the best predictor of chronic lesion volume at 26.14
                 minutes (95\% prediction interval, 24.35-28.11 minutes)
                 after contrast injection. The edema volume in late
                 gadolinium enhancement correlated well with edema volume
                 in T2-weighted MRI with an R(2) of 0.99. CONCLUSION:
                 Microvascular obstruction region on acute late gadolinium
                 enhancement images acquired 26.1 minutes after contrast
                 administration can accurately predict the chronic lesion
                 volume. We also show that T1-weighted MRI images acquired
                 immediately after contrast injection accurately shows
                 edema resulting from radiofrequency ablation.",

                 generally been approached using one of two quite
                 distinct source models, either a potential-based
                 approach or an activation-based approach. Each approach
                 has advantages and disadvantages relative to the other,
                 which are inherited by all specific methods based on a
                 given approach. Recently our group has been working to
                 develop models which can bridge between these two
                 approaches, hoping to capture some of the most
                 important advantages of both. In this work we present
                 one such effort, which we term wavefront-based
                 potential reconstruction (WBPR). It is a modification
                 of standard regularization methods for potential-based
                 inverse electrocardiography, into which we incorporate
                 a constraint based on a wavefront-like approximation to
                 the potential-based solution. Initial results indicate
                 significant improvement with respect to localization
                 and characterization of the wavefront in simulations

                 wavefront-based curve reconstruction (WBCR) and
                 wavefront-based potential reconstruction (WBPR). In the
                 WBCR approach, the epicardial activation wavefront is
                 modeled as a curve evolving on the heart surface, with
                 the evolution governed by factors derived
                 phenomenologically from prior measured data. The body
                 surface potential/wavefront relationship is modeled via
                 an intermediate mapping of wavefront to epicardial
                 potentials, again derived phenomenologically. In the
                 WBPR approach, we iteratively construct an estimate of
                 epicardial potentials from an estimated wavefront curve
                 according to a simplified model and use it as an
                 initial solution in a Tikhonov regularization scheme.
                 Initial simulation results using measured canine
                 epicardial data show considerable improvement in
                 reconstructing activation wavefronts and epicardial
                 potentials with respect to standard Tikhonov solutions.
                 In particular the WBCR method accurately finds the
                 anisotropic propagation early after epicardial pacing,
                 and the WBPR method finds the wavefront (regions of
                 sharp gradient of the potential) both accurately and
                 with minimal smoothing.",

                 undergoing atrial fibrillation ablation with bipolar
                 radiofrequency, we sought to (1) quantify the
                 time-related prevalence of atrial fibrillation
                 postoperatively and identify its risk factors and (2)
                 determine time-related ablation failure and its risk
                 factors. METHODS: From November 2001 to January 2004,
                 513 patients underwent atrial fibrillation ablation
                 (bipolar radiofrequency alone or with cryothermy) and
                 other cardiac operations. Rhythm documented on 3495
                 postoperative electrocardiograms was used to estimate
                 the prevalence of and risk factors for atrial
                 fibrillation across time. Ablation failure was defined
                 as occurrence of atrial fibrillation any time beyond 6
                 months after operation. RESULTS: Prevalence of
                 postoperative atrial fibrillation peaked at about 1
                 month, decreased to 13\% at 6 months, and gradually
                 increased thereafter. Risk factors associated with
                 increased prevalence varied by time period and included
                 older age ( P = .004) for early occurrence, lesion set
                 in permanent atrial fibrillation ( P = .02) for late
                 occurrence, and larger left atrial diameter ( P = .02)
                 and permanent atrial fibrillation ( P < .0001) for
                 occurrence across the entire time span. Freedom from
                 ablation failure was 72\% at 12 months. Risk factors
                 for ablation failure included lesion set in permanent
                 atrial fibrillation ( P = .001), longer duration of
                 atrial fibrillation ( P = .01), and larger left atrial
                 diameter ( P = .03). CONCLUSIONS: Bipolar
                 radiofrequency enables extension of ablation to most
                 cardiac surgical patients with atrial fibrillation.
                 Recurrence is influenced by the type and duration of
                 atrial fibrillation, choice of lesion set in permanent
                 atrial fibrillation, and left atrial size. Early
                 operation, careful choice of lesion set, and left
                 atrial reduction might enhance results.",

                 isolation or a complete Cox-Maze procedure is needed to
                 ablate paroxysmal atrial fibrillation in patients with
                 mitral valve disease. Our objective was to assess the
                 impact of different surgical treatments for this
                 arrhythmia in patients undergoing mitral valve surgery.
                 METHODS: From July 1993 to January 2004, 152 patients
                 underwent combined surgical treatment of paroxysmal
                 atrial fibrillation and mitral valve disease. Ablation
                 procedures included pulmonary vein isolation alone (n =
                 31, 20\%), pulmonary vein isolation with left atrial
                 connecting lesions (n = 80, 53\%), and Cox-Maze (n =
                 41, 27\%). The latter had longer durations of atrial
                 fibrillation than the former (p < 0.0001). Rhythm
                 documented on 1,225 postoperative electrocardiograms
                 was used to estimate prevalence of, and risk factors
                 for, atrial fibrillation across time. Ablation failure
                 was defined as occurrence of atrial fibrillation any
                 time beyond 6 months after operation. RESULTS:
                 Prevalence of postoperative atrial fibrillation peaked
                 at 22\% at 2 weeks and declined to 9\% at 1 year. Risk
                 factors included older age (p = 0.09), larger left
                 atrium (p = 0.05), and rheumatic (p = 0.003) and
                 degenerative etiologies (p = 0.03). Freedom from
                 ablation failure was 84\% at one year. Ablation
                 procedure did not affect prevalence of atrial
                 fibrillation or incidence of ablation failure.
                 CONCLUSIONS: Pulmonary vein isolation alone may be
                 adequate treatment for patients with paroxysmal atrial
                 fibrillation undergoing mitral valve surgery,
                 particularly when it is of short duration. A randomized
                 trial is necessary to examine this strategy, especially
                 in patients with longer duration of paroxysmal atrial
                 fibrillation.",

                  Atrial fibrillation,
                  a cardiac arrhythmia characterized by unsynchronized
                  electrical activity in the atrial chambers of the 
                  heart, is a  
                  rapidly growing problem in modern societies. One treatment,
                  referred to as catheter ablation, targets specific parts of
                  the left atrium for radio frequency ablation using an
                  intracardiac catheter. Magnetic resonance imaging has been
                  used for both pre- and and post-ablation assessment of the
                  atrial wall. Magnetic resonance imaging can aid in selecting
                  the right candidate for the ablation procedure and assessing
                  post-ablation scar formations. Image processing techniques
                  can be used for automatic segmentation of the atrial wall,
                  which facilitates an accurate statistical assessment of the
                  region. As a first step towards the general solution to the
                  computer-assisted segmentation of the left atrial wall, in
                  this paper we use shape learning and shape-based image
                  segmentation to identify the endocardial wall of the left
                  atrium in the delayed-enhancement magnetic resonance images.

                 aims to alter brain function non-invasively via electrodes
                 placed on the scalp. Conventional tDCS uses two relatively
                 large patch electrodes to deliver electrical current to
                 the brain region of interest (ROI). Recent studies have
                 shown that using dense arrays containing up to 512 smaller
                 electrodes may increase the precision of targeting ROIs.
                 However, this creates a need for methods to determine
                 effective and safe stimulus patterns as the number of
                 degrees of freedom is much higher with such arrays.
                 Several approaches to this problem have appeared in the
                 literature. In this paper, we describe a new method for
                 calculating optimal electrode stimulus patterns for
                 targeted and directional modulation in dense array tDCS
                 which differs in some important aspects with methods
                 reported to date. APPROACH: We optimize stimulus pattern
                 of dense arrays with fixed electrode placement to maximize
                 the current density in a particular direction in the ROI.
                 We impose a flexible set of safety constraints on the
                 current power in the brain, individual electrode currents,
                 and total injected current, to protect subject safety. The
                 proposed optimization problem is convex and thus
                 efficiently solved using existing optimization software to
                 find unique and globally optimal electrode stimulus
                 patterns. MAIN RESULTS: Solutions for four anatomical ROIs
                 based on a realistic head model are shown as exemplary
                 results. To illustrate the differences between our
                 approach and previously introduced methods, we compare our
                 method with two of the other leading methods in the
                 literature. We also report on extensive simulations that
                 show the effect of the values chosen for each proposed
                 safety constraint bound on the optimized stimulus
                 patterns. SIGNIFICANCE: The proposed optimization approach
                 employs volume based ROIs, easily adapts to different sets
                 of safety constraints, and takes negligible time to
                 compute. An in-depth comparison study gives insight into
                 the relationship between different objective criteria and
                 optimized stimulus patterns. In addition, the analysis of
                 the interaction between optimized stimulus patterns and
                 safety constraint bounds suggests that more precise
                 current localization in the ROI, with improved safety

                 highlighting of device-mounted receiver coils, accelerated
                 imaging of multiple slices, adaptive projection modes,
                 live three-dimensional (3D) renderings and other

                 pulmonary vein (PV) foci initiating atrial fibrillation
                 (AF) has not been determined. METHODS AND RESULTS:
                 Ninety patients underwent mapping during spontaneous or
                 induced ectopy and/or AF initiation. Ostial PV ablation
                 was performed by use of angiograms to precisely define
                 targeted sites. Success defined by elimination of AF
                 without drugs was correlated with the procedural end
                 point of the abolition of distal PV potentials. A total
                 of 197 arrhythmogenic PV foci (97\%)-single in 31\% and
                 multiple in 69\%-and 6 atrial foci were identified. A
                 discrete radiofrequency (RF) application eliminated the
                 PV potentials in 9 PV foci, whereas 2 foci from the
                 same PV required RF applications at separate sites in
                 19 cases. In others, a wider region was targeted with
                 progressive elimination of ectopy. In 49 patients,
                 multiple sessions were necessary owing to recurrent or
                 new ectopy. The clinical success rates were 93\%, 73\%,
                 and 55\% in patients with 1, 2, and > or =3
                 arrhythmogenic PV foci. Recovery of local PV potential
                 and the inability to abolish it were significantly
                 associated with AF recurrences (90\% success rate with
                 versus 55\% without PV potential abolition). PV
                 stenosis was noted acutely in 5 of 6 cases, remained
                 unchanged at restudy, and was associated with RF power
                 >45 W. CONCLUSIONS: Multiple PV foci are involved in
                 initiation of AF, and elimination of PV muscle
                 conduction is associated with clinical success.",

                 sustained cardiac arrhythmia and a major cause of
                 stroke, results from simultaneous reentrant wavelets.
                 Its spontaneous initiation has not been studied.
                 METHODS: We studied 45 patients with frequent episodes
                 of atrial fibrillation (mean [+/-SD] duration,
                 344+/-326 minutes per 24 hours) refractory to drug
                 therapy. The spontaneous initiation of atrial
                 fibrillation was mapped with the use of multielectrode
                 catheters designed to record the earliest electrical
                 activity preceding the onset of atrial fibrillation and
                 associated atrial ectopic beats. The accuracy of the
                 mapping was confirmed by the abrupt disappearance of
                 triggering atrial ectopic beats after ablation with
                 local radio-frequency energy. RESULTS: A single point
                 of origin of atrial ectopic beats was identified in 29
                 patients, two points of origin were identified in 9
                 patients, and three or four points of origin were
                 identified in 7 patients, for a total of 69 ectopic
                 foci. Three foci were in the right atrium, 1 in the
                 posterior left atrium, and 65 (94 percent) in the
                 pulmonary veins (31 in the left superior, 17 in the
                 right superior, 11 in the left inferior, and 6 in the
                 right inferior pulmonary vein). The earliest activation
                 was found to have occurred 2 to 4 cm inside the veins,
                 marked by a local depolarization preceding the atrial
                 ectopic beats on the surface electrocardiogram by
                 106+/-24 msec. Atrial fibrillation was initiated by a
                 sudden burst of rapid depolarizations (340 per minute).
                 A local depolarization could also be recognized during
                 sinus rhythm and abolished by radiofrequency ablation.
                 During a follow-up period of 8+/-6 months after
                 ablation, 28 patients (62 percent) had no recurrence of
                 atrial fibrillation. CONCLUSIONS: The pulmonary veins
                 are an important source of ectopic beats, initiating
                 frequent paroxysms of atrial fibrillation. These foci
                 respond to treatment with radio-frequency ablation.",

                 (DWI) method for measuring cardiac fiber structure at

                 architecture of seven canine hearts. A novel
                 hypothesis-testing method was developed and used to

                 ratio (SNR) obtained with SSFP is shown to yield
                 improvements in terms of the myocardium-tag
                 contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) and tag persistence when
                 compared to the current standard fast gradient-echo
                 (FGRE) tagging protocol. Myocardium-tag CNR and tag
                 persistence were studied using numerical simulations as
                 well as phantom and human experiments. Both quantities
                 were found to decrease with increasing imaging flip
                 angle (alpha) due to an increased tag decay rate and a
                 decrease in myocardial steady-state signal. However,
                 higher alpha yielded better blood-myocardium contrast,
                 indicating that optimal alpha is dependent on the
                 application: higher alpha for better blood-myocardium
                 boundary visualization, and lower alpha for better tag
                 persistence. SSFP tagging provided the same
                 myocardium-tag CNR as FGRE tagging when acquired at
                 four times the bandwidth and better tag- and
                 blood-myocardium CNRs than FGRE tagging when acquired
                 at equal or twice the receiver bandwidth (RBW). The
                 increased acquisition efficiency of SSFP allowed
                 decreases in breath-hold duration, or increases in
                 temporal resolution, as compared to FGRE.",

                 total systemic arterial blood flow or venous return as
                 well as within specific organs, can be measured.
                 Several techniques have been applied to quantitate flow
                 using microspheres; the reference sample method is
                 extremely simple and by far the most accurate of all.
                 Collection of venous effluent is perhaps more accurate
                 but requires extensive surgery and is almost certainly
                 the least physiologic. Other methods used for
                 quantitation, such as bolus injections of indocyanine
                 green dye or in fusions of diffusable indicators, are
                 considerably less accurate and therefore significantly
                 reduce the reliability of the microsphere technique.
                 Selection of the appropriate size microspheres allows
                 for definition of arteriovenous anastomoses as well as
                 the measurement of organ blood flows and distribution
                 of blood flow within those organs. In most instances,
                 smaller microspheres (15mu diameter or 8-10mu diameter)
                 have significant advantages over larger ones. They are
                 distributed more like red cells, obstruct less of the
                 vascular bed, are less variable in size, and can be
                 given in significantly greater numbers. This latter
                 point is important, since the statistical criteria need
                 to be satisfied and the use of small spheres allows for
                 the more reliable measurement of blood flow to small
                 organs or to small regions of organs.",

                 LA surface in well-known GP areas (which were considered
                 as the substitution of GP areas around the LA) were

                 ablation scar image visualized by late gadolinium

                 Overlapping areas of FP and the ablation scar image were
                 considered as the ablated FP areas containing GP. Patients
                 underwent 24-hour Holter monitoring after ablation for the

                 3.1 cm(2) vs 4.2 +/- 2.7 cm(2) , P = 0.03). The mean

                 most important nonpulmonary vein origins of atrial
                 fibrillation, and SVC should be carefully treated in order
                 to decrease the recurrence of atrial fibrillation after
                 ablation. Despite the fact that pulmonary vein isolation
                 (PVI) should be performed prophylactically for all
                 pulmonary veins, prophylactic SVC isolation (SVCI) is
                 still controversial. This review describes recent data on
                 treatments for SVC focus during atrial fibrillation
                 ablation. RECENT FINDINGS: There are two different major
                 approaches to treat SVC focus during atrial fibrillation
                 ablation. One is the conventional approach, in which SVCI
                 is performed only if atrial fibrillation from SVC origin
                 is recognized using pacing maneuvers and/or isoproterenol
                 infusions. Another approach is performing SVCI in all
                 cases prophylactically in addition to PVI. The rate of
                 atrial fibrillation freedom 1 year after initial atrial
                 fibrillation ablation by prophylactic PVI along with SVCI
                 was almost the same as with the conventional method
                 (85-90\% atrial fibrillation freedom). In addition, the
                 conventional method also had a good result even 5 years
                 after ablation (73.3\%). SUMMARY: Because of the good
                 result after using the conventional approach and possible
                 complications during SVCI, SVCI should be performed only
                 if SVC focus is recognized, not prophylactically.",

                 demonstrated that intended hand motion modulates cortical

                 Decoders were created, providing a 'neural cursor' with

                 CardioInsight Inc., Cleveland) maps the origin and
                 mechanisms of various arrhythmias without catheterizing
                 the heart. METHODS: Thirty-three patients (3 centers, mean
                 45.0+/-14.6y,) with symptomatic premature ventricular
                 complexes (24PVCs), focal atrial tachycardias (2ATs) and
                 manifest accessory pathways (7WPW syndromes) were
                 prospectively explored using 3D, non-invasive bedside
                 electrocardiomapping. The location of origin of the focal
                 arrhythmia was first determined using non-invasive
                 mapping. Subsequently, a stimulus artifact was delivered
                 at this site to confirm and evaluate the precise location
                 of the mapped focal origin. The procedural parameters and
                 clinical efficacy were studied. RESULTS: Ablation was
                 successful in 32/33 (97\%) patients (PVCs:13 right, 10
                 left, 1 septal; WPW:3 left, 3 right; ATs:2 left) without
                 complications. The time from catheterization to permanent
                 arrhythmia elimination/termination, RF duration,
                 skin-to-skin procedural duration and fluoroscopic exposure
                 were median 16min, 3.98min, 71min and 11.9min (for n = 29)
                 respectively. At mean 24.7 +/- 3.7months of follow-up, 31
                 patients remain arrhythmia-free after a single procedure.
                 One patient (right WPW syndrome) required repeat ablation
                 1month later. One patient had recurrence of PVCs and is
                 now deceased. The cumulative radiation (CT scan and
                 fluoroscopy) exposure was median 7.57mSv. CONCLUSION:
                 ECVUETM is a -non-invasive tool allowing rapid
                 pre-procedural localization of focal arrhythmia and
                 enables the electrophysiologist with highly specific
                 information to direct RF delivery at the source of the
                 arrhythmia with minimal intracardiac mapping.",

                 isthmus ablation was performed in an interventional RTMRI
                 suite by using a novel 7 French, steerable,
                 non-ferromagnetic ablation catheter in a porcine in vivo
                 model (n = 20). The catheter was introduced and navigated
                 by RTMRI visualization only. Catheter position and
                 movement during manipulation were continuously visualized
                 during the entire intervention. Two porcine prematurely
                 died due to VT/VF. Anatomical completion of the CTI
                 ablation line could be achieved after a mean of 6.3+/-3 RF
                 pulses (RF energy: 1807+/-1016.4 Ws/RF pulse, temperature:
                 55.9+/-5.9 degrees C) in n = 18 animals. In 15 of 18

                 investigated two issues that are fundamental to
                 advancing that understanding. First, there has been
                 widespread debate over the mechanisms by which an
                 externally applied shock can influence a sufficient
                 volume of heart tissue to terminate cardiac
                 fibrillation. Second, it has been uncertain whether
                 cardiac tissue should be viewed as an electrically
                 orthotropic structure, or whether its electrical
                 properties are, in fact, isotropic in the plane
                 orthogonal to myofiber direction. In the present study,
                 a computer model that incorporates a detailed
                 three-dimensional representation of cardiac muscular
                 architecture is used to investigate these issues. We
                 describe a bidomain model of electrical propagation
                 solved in a discontinuous domain that accurately
                 represents the microstructure of a transmural block of
                 rat left ventricle. From analysis of the model results,
                 we conclude that (1) the laminar organization of
                 myocytes determines unique electrical properties in
                 three microstructurally defined directions at any point
                 in the ventricular wall of the heart, and (2)
                 interlaminar clefts between layers of cardiomyocytes
                 provide a substrate for bulk activation of the
                 ventricles during defibrillation.",

                 electrocardiographic imaging (ECGI) is a novel
                 noninvasive modality for exploring the spread of
                 electrical activation within the ventricular wall. In
                 this study, our goal was to explore the ability of ECGI
                 in reconstructing epicardial potentials and
                 electrograms in the ventricles damaged by localized
                 necroses (<2 cm2). An anatomical model of the human
                 ventricular myocardium was used to simulate activation
                 sequences initiated at 428 epicardial and endocardial
                 pacing sites distributed over the right ventricular and
                 left ventricular free walls. From these realistic
                 sequences, we simulated extracardiac potentials at
                 epicardial (202 sites) and torso surfaces (352 sites)
                 using boundary element model of the human torso. ECGI
                 in terms of the L-curve was applied to compute
                 epicardial potentials and unipolar electrograms (202
                 sites). Inversely computed electrograms correlated well
                 with those simulated by an anatomical model (r > 0.9 at
                 68\% of sites). Specifically, ECGI accurately
                 reconstructed the following features that have been
                 observed during measurements on the exposed canine
                 hearts: (a) an epicardial potential pattern with a
                 central minimum and two maxima, with the minimum
                 positioned above the pacing site; (b) a complete
                 transient loss of one of the positive areas in the
                 epicardial potential pattern when the necrosis was
                 located subepicardially; and (c) a transient gap in the
                 expanding positive areas of the epicardial potential
                 pattern when the necrosis was located intramurally or
                 subendocardially. Findings of our study indicate that
                 ECGI provides detailed reconstruction of patterns of
                 myocardial activation in the presence of localized
                 necroses and may be useful in the assessment of
                 arrhythmogenic substrate in the clinical setting.",

                 Morphological analysis revealed that the ADC decrease

                 precise knowledge of the fiber orientation. Magnetic
                 resonance (MR) diffusion tensor imaging techniques have
                 been used as a nondestructive means to characterize
                 tissue fiber structure; however, the descriptions so
                 far have been mostly qualitative. This study presents a
                 direct, quantitative comparison of high-resolution MR
                 fiber mapping and histology measurements in a block of
                 excised canine myocardium. Results show an excellent
                 correspondence of the measured fiber angles not only on
                 a point-by-point basis (average difference of -2.30 +/-

                 These data strongly support the hypothesis that the
                 eigenvector of the largest MR diffusion tensor
                 eigenvalue coincides with the orientation of the local

                 neural activity are used to fit spherical head models
                 for each individual MEG sensor such that the head is
                 more realistically modelled as a set of overlapping
                 spheres, rather than a single sphere. To assist in the
                 evaluation of this OS model with BEM and other head
                 models, we also introduce a novel comparison technique
                 that is based on a generalized eigenvalue decomposition
                 and accounts for the presence of noise in the MEG data.
                 With this technique we can examine the worst possible
                 errors for thousands of dipole locations in a realistic
                 brain volume. We test the traditional single-sphere
                 model, three-shell and single-shell BEM, and the new OS
                 model. The results show that the OS model has accuracy
                 similar to the BEM but is orders of magnitude faster to

                 were studied to relate features of the signals to the
                 underlying dynamics and tissue substrate. METHODS AND
                 RESULTS: A computer model of entire human atria with a
                 gross fiber architecture based on histology and
                 membrane kinetics based on the Courtemanche et al.
                 atrial model was developed to simulate paced activation
                 and simulated AF. Unipolar electrograms were computed
                 using a current source approximation at 256 sites in
                 right atrium, to simulate a mapping array. The results
                 show the following: (1) In a homogeneous and isotropic
                 tissue, the presence of highly asymmetric electrograms
                 is rare (<2\%), although there is a marked variability
                 in amplitude and symmetry. (2) The introduction of
                 anisotropy increases this variability in symmetry and
                 amplitude of the, electrograms especially for
                 propagation across fibers. The percentage of highly
                 asymmetric electrograms increases to 12\% to 15\% for
                 anisotropy ratios greater than 3:1. (3) Multiphasic and
                 fractionated electrograms are rarely seen in the model
                 with uniform properties but are more common (15\%-17\%)
                 in a model including regions with abrupt changes in
                 conductivity. Beat-to-beat variations in the occurrence
                 of multiphasic signals are possible with fixed anatomic
                 heterogeneity, due to beat-to-beat variations in the
                 direction of the wavefront relative to the
                 heterogeneity. CONCLUSION: Analysis of the amplitude
                 and symmetry of unipolar atrial electrograms can
                 provide information about the electrophysiologic
                 substrate maintaining AF.",

                 recent experimental findings: 1) the Keizer-Levine
                 model for the ryanodine receptor (RyR), which displays
                 adaptation at elevated Ca2+; 2) a model for the L-type
                 Ca2+ channel that inactivates by mode switching; and 3)
                 a restricted subspace into which the RyRs and L-type
                 Ca2+ channels empty and interact via Ca2+. We add
                 membrane currents from the Luo-Rudy Phase II
                 ventricular cell model to our description of Ca2+
                 handling to formulate a new model for ventricular
                 action potentials and Ca2+ regulation. The model can
                 simulate Ca2+ transients during an action potential
                 similar to those seen experimentally. The subspace
                 [Ca2+] rises more rapidly and reaches a higher level
                 (10-30 microM) than the bulk myoplasmic Ca2+ (peak
                 [Ca2+]i approximately 1 microM). Termination of
                 sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) Ca2+ release is
                 predominately due to emptying of the SR, but is
                 influenced by RyR adaptation. Because force generation
                 is roughly proportional to peak myoplasmic Ca2+, we use
                 [Ca2+]i in the model to explore the effects of pacing
                 rate on force generation. The model reproduces
                 transitions seen in force generation due to changes in
                 pacing that cannot be simulated by previous models.
                 Simulation of such complex phenomena requires an
                 interplay of both RyR adaptation and the degree of SR
                 Ca2+ loading. This model, therefore, shows improved
                 behavior over existing models that lack detailed
                 descriptions of subcellular Ca2+ regulatory
                 mechanisms.",

                 function assessed by cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR)
                 imaging within the first year after pulmonary vein
                 isolation (PVI). METHODS: Forty-one patients (28 men; age:
                 57+/-10years) with paroxysmal or non-paroxysmal atrial
                 fibrillation were studied serially using CMR at baseline
                 and at 1-, 3-, 6- and 12-month intervals following PVI. LA
                 diastolic and systolic volumes were determined by cine
                 imaging with full gapless LA coverage applying Simpson's
                 rule. Successful PVI was defined by a persisting sinus
                 rhythm during the 12-month follow-up after a 3-month
                 blanking period; patients with a relapse of atrial
                 fibrillation after the blanking period were censored (4
                 patients at 6-month follow-up and additional 6 patients at
                 12-month follow-up). RESULTS: In all patients, LA
                 diastolic and systolic volumes decreased significantly and
                 progressively during the 12-month follow-up (p<0.001 and
                 p=0.001, respectively). At basegline patients with
                 successful PVI demonstrated a significantly smaller LA
                 diastolic volume compared to patients with relapsed atrial
                 fibrillation (p=0.009). During the 3-month blanking

                 ejection fraction (p=0.028); patients with subsequent
                 relapse of atrial fibrillation, however, exhibited no

                 approach for left-atrial size assessment using
                 cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging in
                 patients with atrial fibrillation and its value for
                 prediction of pulmonary vein isolation (PVI) treatment
                 success. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Eighty patients underwent
                 CMR imaging prior to PVI; the CMR examination included
                 standard cine sequences, a multislice cine sequence in
                 4-chamber orientation with full left-atrial coverage, and
                 a contrast-enhanced MR angiography of the left atrium.
                 Left-atrial size was determined as: diameter, area, volume
                 segmented from angiography, and diastolic/systolic volumes
                 from cine imaging (Simpson's rule). All measurements were
                 carried out by two independent observers and repeated by
                 one observer to assess inter- and intrareader variability.
                 Treatment success was defined as persisting sinus rhythm
                 after PVI (follow-up period 12.6 +/- 6.6 months). RESULTS:
                 All left-atrial measurements showed substantial
                 intrareader agreement. Interreader agreement was
                 substantial for diastolic/systolic left-atrial volumes
                 only. Calculated bias was found to be minimal
                 (0.1\%-4.9\%). Predictability of PVI treatment success was
                 best using cine volumetric measurements (cutoff value for
                 diastolic volume, 112 mL) yielding a sensitivity and
                 specificity of 80\% and 70\%, respectively. CONCLUSION:
                 Left-atrial volumetry based on cine imaging represented
                 the most reproducible approach to determine left-atrial
                 size. PVI success was predicted best using cine volumetry.",

                 prospectively assess the performance of noninvasive
                 electrocardiographic mapping (ECM) in the
                 pre-/periprocedural localization of OTVT origin to guide
                 ablation and to compare the accuracy of ECM with that of
                 published ECG algorithms. METHODS: Patients with
                 symptomatic OTVT/PVCs undergoing clinically indicated
                 ablation were recruited. The OTVT/PVC origin was mapped
                 preprocedurally by using ECM, and 3 published ECG
                 algorithms were applied to the 12-lead ECG by 3 blinded
                 electrophysiologists. Ablation was guided by using ECM.
                 The OTVT/PVC origin was defined as the site where ablation
                 caused arrhythmia suppression. Acute success was defined
                 as abolition of ectopy after ablation. Medium-term success
                 was defined as the abolition of symptoms and reduction of
                 PVC to less than 1000 per day documented on Holter
                 monitoring within 6 months. RESULTS: In 24 patients (mean
                 age 50 +/- 18 years) recruited ECM successfully identified
                 OTVT/PVC origin in 23/24 (96\%) (right ventricular outflow
                 tract, 18; left ventricular outflow tract, 6),
                 sublocalizing correctly in 100\% of this cohort. Acute
                 ablation success was achieved in 100\% of the cases with
                 medium-term success in 22 of 24 patients. PVC burden
                 reduced from 21,837 +/- 23,241 to 1143 +/- 4039 (P <
                 .0001). ECG algorithms identified the correct chamber of
                 origin in 50\%-88\% of the patients and sublocalized
                 within the right ventricular outflow tract (septum vs
                 free-wall) in 37\%-58\%. CONCLUSIONS: ECM can accurately
                 identify OTVT/PVC origin in the left and the right
                 ventricle pre- and periprocedurally to guide catheter
                 ablation with an accuracy superior to that of published
                 ECG algorithms.",

                 about the distribution of the electric field induced by

                 detailed model is an accurate description of the cortical
                 surface geometry. Since its estimation is difficult, it is
                 important to know how accurate the geometry has to be
                 represented. Previous studies only looked at the
                 differences caused by neglecting the complete boundary
                 between cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and grey matter
                 (Thielscher et al 2011 NeuroImage 54 234-43, Bijsterbosch
                 et al 2012 Med. Biol. Eng. Comput. 50 671-81), or by
                 resizing the whole brain (Wagner et al 2008 Exp. Brain
                 Res. 186 539-50). However, due to the high conductive
                 properties of the CSF, it can be expected that alterations
                 in sulcus width can already have a significant effect on
                 the distribution of the electric field. To answer this
                 question, the sulcus width of a highly realistic head
                 model, based on T1-, T2- and diffusion-weighted magnetic
                 resonance images, was altered systematically. This study
                 shows that alterations in the sulcus width do not cause
                 large differences in the majority of the electric field
                 values. However, considerable overestimation of sulcus
                 width produces an overestimation of the calculated field
                 strength, also at locations distant from the target
                 location.",

                 motor cortex is correlated with various limb movement
                 parameters, including velocity. Recent findings obtained
                 using local field potentials suggest that hand speed may
                 also be encoded in the summed activity of neuronal
                 populations. At this macroscopic level, the motor cortex
                 has also been shown to display synchronized rhythmic
                 activity modulated by motor behavior. Yet whether and how
                 neural oscillations might be related to limb speed control
                 is still poorly understood. Here, we applied
                 magnetoencephalography (MEG) source imaging to the ongoing
                 brain activity in subjects performing a continuous
                 visuomotor (VM) task. We used coherence and phase
                 synchronization to investigate the coupling between the
                 estimated activity throughout the brain and the
                 simultaneously recorded instantaneous hand speed. We found
                 significant phase locking between slow (2- to 5-Hz)
                 oscillatory activity in the contralateral primary motor
                 cortex and time-varying hand speed. In addition, we report
                 long-range task-related coupling between primary motor
                 cortex and multiple brain regions in the same frequency
                 band. The detected large-scale VM network spans several
                 cortical and subcortical areas, including structures of
                 the frontoparietal circuit and the
                 cerebello-thalamo-cortical pathway. These findings suggest
                 a role for slow coherent oscillations in mediating neural
                 representations of hand kinematics in humans and provide
                 further support for the putative role of long-range neural
                 synchronization in large-scale VM integration. Our
                 findings are discussed in the context of corticomotor
                 communication, distributed motor encoding, and possible
                 implications for brain-machine interfaces.",

                 children are complicated by size and anatomy. Creative
                 ad hoc implant techniques are utilized but have not
                 been fully validated. We used subject-specific,
                 image-based finite element models (FEMs) to compare
                 electric fields and expected defibrillation thresholds
                 (DFTs) using standard and novel electrode locations.
                 Methods: FEMs were created by segmenting normal torso
                 CT scans of 2 children and 1 adult[ages 2, 10, and
                 29years] into tissue compartments, meshing and
                 assigning tissue conductivities. FEMs were modified by
                 interactive placement of ICD electrodes in a variety of
                 reported and anatomically feasible locations. The
                 critical mass hypothesis was used to define effective
                 defibrillation. Potentials, electric fields, and
                 currents were computed and interactively visualized
                 using SCIRun. Results: Computed DFTs for standard
                 transvenous configurations in the adult were similar to
                 published results. Thoracic subcutaneous electrodes
                 resulted in high but clinically feasible DFTs, and
                 generated more homogenous electric fields than
                 electrodes close to the heart. Contralateral
                 extracardiac placement of can and electrode predicted
                 lower DFTs than ipsilateral. Differences in lead
                 placement and patient anatomy produced significant
                 variation (e.g., up to 100\% DFT variation with a four
                 rib difference in lead placement). Transvenous and
                 epicardial leads had lower DFTs but greater field
                 variance and very high (>60V/cm) local myocardial
                 voltage gradients in some orientations. Conclusions:
                 Image based FEMs provide insight into clinical
                 defibrillation scenarios. Extracardiac ICDs are
                 predicted to be effective in both children and adults.
                 Our method, developed using open source tools, may aid
                 ICD development and patient-specific optimization of
                 electrode placement in patients with small and/or

                 image-based finite element models (FEM) to predict the
                 myocardial electric field generated during defibrillation
                 shocks (pseudo-DFT) in a wide variety of reported and
                 innovative subcutaneous electrode positions to determine
                 factors affecting optimal lead positions for subcutaneous
                 implantable cardioverter-defibrillators (S-ICD). METHODS:
                 An image-based FEM of an adult man was used to predict
                 pseudo-DFTs across a wide range of technically feasible
                 S-ICD electrode placements. Generator location, lead
                 location, length, geometry and orientation, and spatial
                 relation of electrodes to ventricular mass were
                 systematically varied. Best electrode configurations were
                 determined, and spatial factors contributing to low

                 (21\%) had pseudo-DFT ratios </=1, indicating the
                 possibility of multiple novel, efficient, and clinically
                 relevant orientations. Favorable alignment of
                 lead-generator vector with ventricular myocardium and
                 increased lead length were the most important factors
                 correlated with pseudo-DFT, accounting for 70\% of the
                 predicted variation (R(2) = 0.70, each factor P < .05) in
                 a combined general linear model in which parameter
                 estimates were calculated for each factor. CONCLUSION:
                 Further exploration of novel and efficient electrode
                 configurations may be of value in the development of the
                 S-ICD technologies and implant procedure. FEM modeling
                 suggests that the choice of configurations that maximize
                 shock vector alignment with the center of myocardial mass
                 and use of longer leads is more likely to result in lower
                 DFT.",

                 pulmonary hypoplasia, pulmonary hypertension and heart
                 failure. In approximately 30\% of CDH patients, genomic

                 including chromosomal anomalies, copy number variants and
                 sequence variants. The affected genes identified in CDH
                 patients include transcription factors, such as GATA4,

                 the safety and efficacy of pulmonary vein antrum
                 isolation in patients with moderate valvular heart
                 disease or open-heart surgery and atrial fibrillation
                 (AF). BACKGROUND: Valvular heart disease and open-heart
                 surgery are commonly associated with AF and increase
                 the risk of adverse events in AF patients. METHODS: A
                 total of 391 consecutive patients who had pulmonary
                 vein antrum isolation performed between December 2000
                 and December 2002 were screened. A total of 142 of
                 these patients had clinically significant valvular
                 disease or prior cardiac surgery. End points included
                 AF recurrence and pulmonary vein antrum isolation
                 complication rates. RESULTS: Patients with valvular
                 heart disease or prior open-heart surgery were older,
                 had larger left atria and a more advanced New York
                 Heart Association class. They did not differ
                 significantly with respect to gender, but had a longer
                 history of AF. Procedure times were similar between
                 patients with and without valvular heart disease or
                 prior open-heart surgery. After 18 +/- 7 months in the
                 lone AF patients, 11 +/- 5 months in patients with
                 valvular heart disease, and 10 +/- 5 months in patients
                 with prior open heart surgery, there was a trend toward
                 lower recurrence of AF in patients with lone AF who
                 enjoyed a 98\% overall cure rate after up to 2
                 pulmonary vein antrum isolations versus 93\% among
                 patients with valvular heart disease (P = .04) and
                 prior open heart surgery (P = .07). Complication rates
                 were comparable between groups. CONCLUSIONS: Pulmonary
                 vein antrum isolation is safe and effective in patients
                 with moderate valvular heart disease and the patients
                 who developed AF after open-heart surgery. These
                 results have implications for our understanding of the
                 pathophysiology of AF in patients with moderate
                 valvular heart disease or past cardiac surgery and
                 should be considered when discussing treatment options
                 in these patients.",

                 devices built for animal use: focal cryo-catheter with 8
                 mm tip and 28 mm diameter cryo-balloon. The main steps of
                 MRI-guided cardiac cryo-ablation procedure (real-time
                 navigation, confirmation of tip-tissue contact,
                 confirmation of vessel occlusion, real-time monitoring of
                 a freeze zone formation, and intra-procedural assessment
                 of lesions) were validated in a 3 Tesla clinical MRI
                 scanner. 
                 Specifically, contact between catheter tip and myocardium
                 and occlusion of superior vena cava (SVC) by the balloon
                 was visually validated. Focal cryo-lesions were created in
                 the RV septum. Circumferential ablation of SVC-RA junction
                 with no gaps was achieved using the cryo-balloon.
                 Real-time visualization of freeze zone formation was
                 achieved in all studies when lesions were successfully
                 created. The ablations and presence of collateral damage

                 validation of vessel occlusion by cryo-balloon, real-time
                 monitoring of a freeze zone formation, and

                 complication during pulmonary vein antrum isolation
                 (PVAI). Microembolic signals (MES) have been associated
                 with stroke and neurological impairment. However, the
                 incidence of MES during PVAI, and their relationship to
                 microbubble formation and radiofrequency (RF)
                 parameters are unknown. OBJECTIVES: We sought to assess
                 the relationship between MES, microbubble detection,
                 and neurological outcome and the impact of RF titration
                 strategy on these parameters. METHODS: We studied 202
                 patients in two groups undergoing PVAI using an
                 intracardiac echocardiography (ICE)-guided technique.
                 MES were detected by transcranial Doppler (TCD) using
                 insonation of the middle cerebral arteries. The number
                 of microbubbles on ICE were qualitatively labeled as
                 FEW, MODERATE, and SHOWER. In group I (n = 107), RF
                 output was titrated to avoid microbubble formation and
                 in group II (n = 95), standard power-limited RF output
                 was used. RESULTS: TCD detected MES in all 202 patients
                 during PVAI with an average of 1,793 +/- 547 per
                 patient; 90\% were detected during left atrial
                 ablation. Over 85\% of MES occurred after microbubbles.
                 Group I patients had significantly lower numbers of MES
                 (1,015 +/- 438 per patient) compared to group II
                 patients (2,250 +/- 864 per patient) (P < 0.05). Group
                 II also had a 3.1\% incidence of acute neurological
                 complications versus 0.9\% in group I (P = 0.10).
                 Patients with clinical events had significantly higher
                 numbers of MES. There were no significant correlations
                 between RF power, temperature, or impedence and MES
                 number. CONCLUSIONS: MES directly correlate to the
                 amount of microbubble formation on ICE, and may result
                 in cerebroembolic complications. Titration of RF
                 according to microbubble formation by ICE during PVAI
                 may be important for minimizing the occurrence of MES
                 and possibly acute neurological complications.",

                 The infarct-related vessel was patent in 50 patients
                 and occluded in the remaining 16. In 6 of the 15
                 patients in whom thrombolytic therapy was started
                 within 2 hours of the onset of chest pain the
                 ST-segment changed from that of an acute infarction
                 pattern to that of a normal pattern, and the QRS
                 pattern either remained normal or recovered prior to
                 discharge. In two additional patients the QRS pattern
                 returned to normal prior to discharge from the
                 hospital. In the 51 patients with later thrombolytic
                 therapy (> or = 2 hours) the degree of ST elevation and
                 depression decreased more than either the control

                 distinguish those with successful thrombolysis. Early
                 reperfusion could be detected by body surface potential

                 in shape and orientation. Tensor shape and orientation
                 both have three degrees-of-freedom, spanned by invariant

                 equivocal electrocardiographic (ECG) responses (> or
                 =100 microV upsloping STD), but the performance of
                 these methods in patients with truly negative ECG
                 responses (<100 microV STD) has not been examined in
                 detail. We reviewed negative standard exercise ECGs in
                 54 men and women (mean age 61 years) with coronary
                 disease, comprising 16\% of consecutive treadmill tests
                 that were performed in 337 patients with angiographic
                 coronary artery disease or stable angina. Mean STD was
                 only 63 +/- 21 microV (0.63 mm) in these negative
                 tests. Despite these subthreshold values for STD, the
                 ST/HR index was abnormal (> or =1.6 microV/bpm) in 27
                 of 54 patients (50\%) when STD was adjusted for the
                 change in HR during exercise. Compared with patients
                 with normal values for HR-adjusted STD, patients with
                 an abnormal ST/HR index were slightly older (64 vs. 58
                 years, P < 0.05) and demonstrated a trend toward lower
                 exercise duration (10.0 vs. 11.8 min). An abnormal
                 ST/HR index was associated with greater subthreshold
                 STD (73 vs. 53 microV, P < 0.0005) and smaller HR
                 change (35 vs. 56 bpm, P < 0.0001) with exercise. Among
                 the 27 patients with a normal ST/HR index by simple HR
                 adjustment, 11 (44\%) had abnormal ST/HR slopes (> or
                 =2.4 microV/bpm) by the more complex linear regression
                 method. Therefore, HR adjustment of STD contributes to
                 the improved sensitivity of the exercise ECG by correct
                 classification of some patients with truly negative
                 standard tests. The magnitude of subthreshold STD and
                 the extent of HR change with exercise both contribute
                 to improved test performance. The increased sensitivity
                 afforded by HR adjustment of STD highlights the
                 importance of the precise measurement of subthreshold
                 STD that is afforded by computerized ECG during
                 exercise testing.",

                 echocardiographically determined atrial size may be
                 used as a marker for atrial fibrosis. METHODS: In six
                 dogs, pacemakers were implanted followed by HIS bundle
                 ablation. After 4 weeks of rapid ventricular
                 stimulation (185 bpm) for CHF induction, additional
                 rapid atrial stimulation (500 bpm) was maintained for 7
                 weeks to induce AF. Serial determinations of
                 echocardiographic atrial size were performed. Seven
                 dogs with sinus rhythm served as histological controls.
                 Postmortem tissue was obtained to determine the degree
                 and composition of atrial fibrosis. RESULTS: While the
                 ejection fraction of the AF/CHF dogs decreased
                 significantly from 57+/-5\% to 19+/-7\% (P<.01), an
                 increased degree of atrial fibrosis was found (right

                 4.4+/-1.6\% to 22.2+/-3.2\%; P<.01), accompanied by a
                 significant increase of atrial volumes (LA: 21+/-4 to
                 44+/-4 mm(3); P<.01; RA: 10+/-3 to 18+/-6 mm(3); P<.05)
                 and LA diameters (34+/-4 to 43+/-2 mm, P<.05). Atrial
                 fibrosis and size significantly correlated.
                 CONCLUSIONS: Atrial fibrillation/CHF leads to a
                 significant atrial fibrosis and dilation. The increased
                 echocardiographic size correlates to the degree of
                 atrial fibrosis and may be used as clinical marker for
                 atrial fibrosis. The fibrosis accompanying atrial
                 dilatation may also explain why LA size, as determined
                 by echocardiography, is a strong predictor of CV

                 (MAPs) in both clinical and experimental research, the
                 mechanism underlying the genesis of the contact MAP
                 remains unproven. The Franz hypothesis assumes that the
                 MAP is driven by a current source originating at the
                 boundary between cells depolarized by the MAP electrode
                 pressure and normal cells immediately adjacent to it.
                 To date, no direct experimental data exist to support
                 this hypothesis. METHODS AND RESULTS: In 10

                 upward-facing RV free wall. During stable contact and
                 stable MAP recording, KCl-filled glass microelectrodes
                 were lowered from above the RV to record transmembrane
                 action potentials (TAPs) at the center of and 0.05 and
                 0.2 mm outside the perimeter of the MAP electrode
                 contact site. TAPs at the center had normal resting
                 potentials (RP) in epicardial layers (-78 +/- 4 mV) but
                 showed gradual decrease toward deeper layers, reaching
                 a minimum RP of -23 +/- 0.8 mV directly above the MAP
                 electrode surface. RPs at 0.05 mm outside the MAP
                 perimeter were normal at the epicardial surface and
                 with increasing transmural depth showed significantly
                 less decrease than central recordings (min RP -41 +/-
                 0.8 mV, n = 11, P < 0.00001). TAPs at 0.2 mm from the
                 MAP electrode perimeter had normal RPs across the
                 entire RV wall. CONCLUSION: These direct data are the
                 first to support the hypothesis that the MAP is
                 generated locally through pressure depolarization of a
                 circumscript volume of cells that (1) has sharp voltage
                 gradients toward normal cells, (2) provides a strong
                 local current source, and (3) when simulated with a
                 circuit model creates the field potential recorded by
                 the contact MAP electrode.",

                 applications at the organ scale. However, model
                 predictions are rarely associated with a confidence
                 measure although there are important sources of
                 uncertainty in computational physiology methods. For
                 instance, the sparsity and noise of the clinical data used
                 to adjust the model parameters (personalization), and the
                 difficulty in modeling accurately soft tissue physiology.
                 The recent theoretical progresses in stochastic models
                 make their use computationally tractable, but there is
                 still a challenge in estimating patient-specific
                 parameters with such models. In this work we propose an
                 efficient Bayesian inference method for model
                 personalization using polynomial chaos and compressed
                 sensing. This method makes Bayesian inference feasible in
                 real 3D modeling problems. We demonstrate our method on
                 cardiac electrophysiology. We first present validation
                 results on synthetic data, then we apply the proposed
                 method to clinical data. We demonstrate how this can help
                 in quantifying the impact of the data characteristics on
                 the personalization (and thus prediction) results.
                 Described method can be beneficial for the clinical use of
                 personalized models as it explicitly takes into account
                 the uncertainties on the data and the model parameters
                 while still enabling simulations that can be used to
                 optimize treatment. Such uncertainty handling can be
                 pivotal for the proper use of modeling as a clinical tool,
                 because there is a crucial requirement to know the
                 confidence one can have in personalized models. INRIA",

                 by conventional treatment modalities because of
                 incessant or frequent, recurrent VT. RF current
                 application for ablation of 9 VTs (mean cycle length,
                 402 +/-78 ms) was attempted in 8 patients with
                 idiopathic DCM. No further episodes of incessant VT
                 occurred in the patients who had undergone RF current
                 application for ablation of incessant VT. A complete
                 prevention of VT could be achieved in 2 of 8 patients,
                 whereas in 5 patients, VT episodes were stored in the
                 ICD devices during follow-up. The results of the

                 ablation of VT in a select group of patients with
                 idiopathic DCM is feasible. The efficacy of RF ablation
                 may be high in patients presenting with incessant VT,
                 whereas the success rate seems to be only moderate in
                 patients with chronic recurrent VT. In all patients,
                 additional treatment options, including antiarrhythmic
                 drugs, ICDs, and/or heart transplantation, were applied
                 after RF ablation, indicating that RF ablation for this

                 ablation was performed in 68 patients (age 62 +/- 14
                 years, 68\% males) with paroxysmal (n = 26) and persistent

                 mild LA SRM (<10\%, n = 31) and group 2 with
                 moderate-severe LA SRM (>10\%, n = 37) by delayed

                 rate during left ventricular systole by velocity vector
                 imaging were performed pre and at 6 +/- 3 months
                 postablation. The long-term outcome was monitored for 12
                 months. RESULTS: Patients in group 1 were younger (57 +/-
                 15 vs 66 +/- 13 years, P = .009) with a male predominance
                 (80\% vs 57\%, P < .05) as compared to group 2.
                 Postablation, group 1 had significant increase in average
                 LA strain (Delta upward arrow: 14\% vs 4\%, P < .05) and
                 strain rate (Delta upward arrow: 0.5 vs 0.1 cm/s, P < .05)
                 as compared to group 2. There was a trend toward more
                 patients with persistent AF in group 2 (68\% vs 55\%, P =
                 .2), but it was not statistically significant. Group 2 had
                 more AF recurrences (41\% vs 16\%, P = .02) at 12 months
                 after ablation. CONCLUSION: Mild preablation LA SRM by
                 DEMRI predicts favorable LA structural and functional
                 reverse remodeling and long-term success after catheter
                 ablation of AF, irrespective of the paroxysmal or
                 persistent nature of AF.",

                 recognized as the most reliable indicator of
                 temperature. The chemical shift is the only
                 frequency-based parameter and is independent of the
                 other parameters, which are measured based on the
                 intensity of the MR signal. In this paper, the basic

                 spectroscopic imaging over phase mapping for measuring

		  than global image statistics and evolve a contour based on
		  local information. Localized contours are capable of
		  segmenting objects with heterogeneous feature profiles that
		  would be difficult to capture correctly using a standard
		  global method. The presented technique is versatile enough to
		  be used with any global region-based active contour energy
		  and instill in it the benefits of localization. We describe
		  this framework and demonstrate the localization of three
		  well-known energies in order to illustrate how our framework
		  can be applied to any energy. We then compare each localized
		  energy to its global counterpart to show the improvements
		  that can be achieved. Next, an in-depth study of the
		  behaviors of these energies in response to the degree of
		  localization is given. Finally, we show results on
		  challenging images to illustrate the robust and accurate
		  segmentations that are possible with this new class of active
		  contour models.",

                 predicting arrhythmic events: abnormal intra-QRS
                 potentials (AIQP). METHODS AND RESULTS: We studied 173
                 patients followed after myocardial infarction for a
                 mean duration of 14 +/- 7 months. Sixteen arrhythmic
                 events occurred, defined as sudden cardiac death,
                 documented sustained ventricular tachycardia, or
                 non-fatal cardiac arrest. Noninvasive indices of
                 arrhythmia risk were measured, including AIQP,
                 conventional SAECG, Holter, and left ventricular
                 ejection fraction (LVEF). Abnormal intra-QRS potentials
                 were defined as abnormal signals occurring anywhere
                 within the QRS period. They were estimated with a
                 lead-specific, parametric modeling method that removed
                 the smooth, predictable part of the QRS. AIQPs are
                 characterized by the remaining transient, unpredictable
                 component of the QRS and manifest as low- amplitude
                 notches and slurs. A combined XYZ-lead AIQP index
                 exhibited higher specificity (95\%) and predictive value
                 (PV) (+PV, 47\%; -PV, 94\%) than the conventional SAECG
                 in combination with Holter and LVEF (specificity, 89\%;
                 +PV, 25\%; -PV, 93\%). CONCLUSIONS: AIQP improved

                 well-established animal model of atrial fibrillation
                 (AF). However, this model is limited by a high
                 mortality rate and severe heart failure. The purpose of
                 our study was to assess a new canine model of inducible
                 AF. Methods and Results: We performed acute,
                 short-term, simultaneous atrio-ventricular pacing
                 (SAVP) and RVP (in random order) in 14 dogs for 30
                 seconds. SAVP produced more echocardiographic pulmonary
                 venous flow reversal, a greater increase in mean
                 pulmonary capillary wedge pressure and a significantly
                 greater decrease in left atrial emptying function
                 (-84.4 +/- 38.6\% vs. -23.7 +/- 27.1\%, p < 0.05), than
                 RVP. Thirty dogs were randomized to three, longer-term,
                 study groups: eight control (no pacing; CTRL), eight to
                 RVP (2 weeks at 240 bpm followed by 3 weeks at 220
                 bpm), and fourteen to SAVP (2 weeks at 220 bpm). SAVP
                 induced less left ventricular dysfunction, but more
                 left atrial dysfunction, than RVP. SAVP dogs had
                 similar atrial effective refractory periods as RVP
                 dogs, but more heterogeneity in conduction and more AF
                 inducibility (83\% vs. 40\%, p < 0.05), and maintenance
                 (median 1660 s vs. 710 s, p < 0.05) than RVP dogs. SAVP
                 induced more collagen turnover and was associated with
                 a significantly greater increase in type III collagen
                 in the atria compared to RVP dogs (6.9 +/- 1.5 vs. 4.8
                 +/- 1.6 respectively, p < 0.05 vs. 1.1 +/- 0.7 in
                 unpaced controls). Conclusion: The SAVP model induced
                 profound mechanical and substrate atrial remodeling and
                 reproducible sustained AF. This new model is clinically
                 relevant and may be useful for testing AF

                 METHODS AND RESULTS: Epicardial mapping, tagged MRI,
                 and hemodynamics were obtained in dogs with
                 LBBB-failing hearts during right atrial, LV, and BiV

                 and aortic pulse pressure) compared with atrial

                 in atrial fibrillation (AF), particularly in the
                 setting of structural heart disease. In a canine model,
                 congestive heart failure (CHF) produces significant
                 atrial fibrosis and the substrate for sustained AF.
                 This atrial remodeling is a potential therapeutic
                 target. The objective of the present study is to
                 evaluate the effects of the antifibrotic drug
                 pirfenidone (PFD) on arrhythmogenic atrial remodeling
                 in a canine CHF model. METHODS AND RESULTS: We studied
                 15 canines, divided equally into 3 groups: control, CHF
                 canines not treated with PFD, and CHF canines treated
                 with PFD. CHF was induced by ventricular tachypacing
                 (220 bpm for 3 weeks), and oral PFD was administered
                 for the 3-week pacing period. We performed
                 electrophysiology and AF vulnerability studies, atrial
                 fibrosis measurements, and atrial cytokine expression
                 studies. Only canines in the untreated CHF group
                 developed sustained AF (>30 minutes, 4 of 5 canines;
                 P<0.05). Treatment of CHF canines with PFD resulted in
                 an attenuation of arrhythmogenic left atrial
                 remodeling, with a significant reduction in left atrial
                 conduction heterogeneity index (median [25\% to 75\%
                 interquartile range] 4.96 [3.53 to 5.64] versus 2.52
                 [2.11 to 2.82], P<0.01; pacing cycle length 300 ms),
                 left atrial fibrosis (16.0\% [13.0\% to 17.5\%] versus
                 8.7\% [5.7\% to 10.6\%], P<0.01), and AF duration (1800
                 [1020 to 1800] seconds versus 6 [5 to 22] seconds,
                 P<0.01). Immunoblotting studies demonstrated the drug's
                 effects on multiple cytokines, including a reduction in
                 transforming growth factor-beta1 expression.
                 CONCLUSIONS: Treatment of CHF canines with PFD results
                 in significantly reduced arrhythmogenic atrial
                 remodeling and AF vulnerability. Pharmacological
                 therapy targeted at the fibrotic substrate itself may
                 play an important role in the management of AF.",

                 commonly sustained arrhythmia in adults, few studies have
                 examined the direct treatment cost of AF. METHODS: A
                 Medicare database of a 5\% random national sample of all
                 beneficiaries was used to identify patients diagnosed with
                 AF in 2003 and to follow them for 1 year after diagnosis.
                 These patients were matched on a 1:1 basis by age, gender
                 and race. The incremental cost of treating AF was
                 calculated with multivariate regression models adjusting
                 for covariates. RESULTS: In total, 55,260 subjects
                 developed new AF, of which 69\% were >or=75 years old,
                 54\% were female and 91\% were White. The adjusted mean
                 incremental treatment cost of AF was \$14,199 (95\%
                 confidence interval \$13,201-15,001; p<0.01). Some of this
                 cost was attributable to the incidence of stroke and heart
                 failure at the 1-year post-AF diagnosis. A significantly
                 higher proportion of AF patients experienced stroke (23.1
                 vs. 13.3\%; p<0.01) and heart failure (36.7 vs. 10.4\%;
                 p<0.01) compared with Medicare beneficiaries without AF.
                 CONCLUSIONS: Mean incremental direct treatment costs for
                 Medicare beneficiaries with AF were higher than previously
                 reported. Interventions that can reduce the incidence of
                 AF and its complications may also reduce the national
                 economic impact of AF.",

                 recurrences (ER) are controversial. We investigated

                 impact of early reablation on clinical outcome. METHODS:
                 An
                 overwhelming majority of patients with recurrences within
                 the first month after ablation have late recurrences. An
                 early reablation reduces the incidence of further
                 recurrences. However, the overall number of procedures is

                 resistively coupled excitable cables with membrane
                 dynamics described by the modified Beeler Reuter model.
                 Transverse connections have a resistance Rn and are
                 regularly distributed with a spacing delta on any given
                 cable, to provide alternating input and output
                 junctions. Flat wave longitudinal propagation
                 corresponds to propagation along a single continuous
                 cable since all units of the network are functionally
                 isolated due to the absence of transverse current flow.
                 Events on a given cable during flat transverse
                 propagation include electrotonic spread of potential
                 from input to output junctions, action potential
                 initiation at input junctions, and collision at output
                 junctions. The propagating two-dimensional transverse
                 wavefront is an undulating transmembrane potential
                 surface with highs at the input junctions and lows at
                 the output junctions. The action potential upstroke is
                 also modulated in a periodic manner with minimum and
                 maximum Vmax at the input and output junctions
                 respectively. Thus, the network is capable of a
                 diversity of dynamic behavior spatially distributed in
                 relation to the specific pattern of transverse
                 connections chosen. Overall, the behavior of the
                 network model is in good agreement with available
                 structural and electrophysiological data on myocardium.
                 In addition, this network topology allows to handle
                 more easily parameters governing propagation and to
                 avoid very large matrices which are costly in
                 computational effort and overall computer time.",

                 The sheet is a set of parallel, continuous, and uniform
                 cables, transversely interconnected by a brick-wall
                 arrangement of fixed resistors. In accord with
                 experimental observations on cardiac tissue,
                 longitudinal propagation is continuous, whereas
                 transverse propagation exhibits discontinuous features.
                 The width and length of the sheet are 1.5 and 5 cm,
                 respectively, and the anisotropy ratio is fixed at
                 approximately 4:1. The membrane model is a modified
                 Beeler-Reuter formulation incorporating faster sodium
                 current dynamics. We fixed the basic wavelength and
                 action potential duration of the propagating impulse by
                 dividing the time constants of the secondary inward
                 current by an integer K. Reentry was initiated by a
                 standard cross-shock protocol, and the rotating
                 activity appeared as curling patterns around the point
                 of junction (the q-point) of the activation (A) and
                 recovery (R) fronts. The curling R front always
                 precedes the A front and is separated from it by the
                 excitable gap. In addition, the R front is occasionally
                 shifted abruptly through a merging with a slow-moving
                 triggered secondary recovery front that is dissociated
                 from the A front and q-point. Sustained irregular
                 reentry associated with substantial excitable gap
                 variations was simulated with short wavelengths (K = 8
                 and K = 4). Unsustained reentry was obtained with a
                 longer wavelength (K = 2), leading to a breakup of the
                 q-point locus and the triggering of new activation

                 tissue was used to study the estimation of
                 transmembrane current (EIm) from extracellular
                 potential recordings. METHODS AND RESULTS: The
                 simulated EIm of transmembrane current was compared
                 with the simulated transmembrane current (Im), and both
                 simulated values were compared with experimentally
                 derived EIm obtained during sinus rhythm and
                 ventricular fibrillation in dogs. We found that
                 although EIm measurements slightly overestimate the
                 duration of the Im waveform, they provide a reasonable
                 approximation of Im during normal conduction and during
                 decremental conduction and conduction block.
                 CONCLUSIONS: There is a very clear linear correlation
                 between the time spent at or below 25\% of the peak
                 inward transmembrane current (Im25), its corresponding
                 estimate (EIm25), the peak inward Im and EIm, and the
                 peak ionic current, providing some evidence that EIm25
                 may be a suitable in vivo measure of peak ionic

                 and thus the associated electroencephalography (EEG) and
                 magnetoencephalography (MEG) signals. We used a finite
                 element method (FEM) to construct a realistic model of the
                 head of an infant based on MRI images. Using this model,
                 we investigated the effects of the fontanels, sutures and
                 skull conductivity on forward and inverse EEG and MEG

                 better suited than EEG to study early brain development
                 because it is much less sensitive than EEG to distortions
                 of the volume current caused by the fontanels and sutures
                 and to inaccurate estimates of skull conductivity. Best
                 results will be achieved when MEG and EEG are used in

                 elevation, but little direct evidence is available. We
                 studied mice with homozygous knockout (KO) of the
                 Kir6.2 gene, which encodes the pore-forming subunit of
                 cardiac surface K(ATP) channels. Patch-clamp studies in
                 cardiomyocytes confirmed that surface K(ATP) current
                 was indeed absent in KO, but robust in cells from
                 wild-type mice (WT). We then measured continuous
                 electrocardiograms in anesthetized adult mice before
                 and after open-chest ligation of the left anterior
                 descending artery (LAD). Whereas ST elevation was
                 readily evident in WT after LAD ligation, it was
                 markedly suppressed in KO. In support of the concept
                 that K(ATP) channels are responsible for ST elevation,
                 the surface K(ATP)channel blocker HMR1098 (5 mg/kg IP)

                 underlying signal transduction mechanisms are unknown.
                 This study assessed the effects of ACE inhibition on
                 arrhythmogenic atrial remodeling and associated
                 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) changes in a
                 dog model of congestive heart failure (CHF). METHODS
                 AND RESULTS: Dogs were subjected to various durations
                 of ventricular tachypacing (VTP, 220 to 240 bpm) in the
                 presence or absence of oral enalapril 2 mg. kg(-1).
                 d(-1). VTP for 5 weeks induced CHF, local atrial
                 conduction slowing, and interstitial fibrosis and
                 prolonged atrial burst pacing-induced AF. Atrial
                 angiotensin II concentrations and MAPK expression were
                 increased by tachypacing, with substantial changes in
                 phosphorylated forms of c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK),
                 extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), and
                 p38-kinase. Enalapril significantly reduced
                 tachypacing-induced changes in atrial angiotensin II
                 concentrations and ERK expression. Enalapril also
                 attenuated the effects of CHF on atrial conduction
                 (conduction heterogeneity index reduced from 3.1+/-0.4
                 to 1.9+/-0.2 ms/mm, P<0.05), atrial fibrosis (from
                 11.9+/-1.1\% to 7.5+/-0.4\%, P<0.01), and mean AF
                 duration (from 651+/-164 to 218+/-75 seconds, P<0.05).
                 Vasodilator therapy of a separate group of VTP dogs
                 with hydralazine and isosorbide mononitrate did not
                 alter CHF-induced fibrosis or AF promotion.
                 CONCLUSIONS: CHF-induced increases in angiotensin II
                 content and MAPK activation contribute to
                 arrhythmogenic atrial structural remodeling. ACE
                 inhibition interferes with signal transduction leading
                 to the AF substrate in CHF and may represent a useful

                 pacing (RAP; 400 bpm) with a controlled ventricular
                 rate (AV block plus ventricular pacemaker at 80 bpm).
                 METHODS AND RESULTS: CHF induced by 5 weeks of rapid
                 ventricular pacing (220 to 240 bpm) increased the
                 duration of AF induced by burst pacing (from 8+/-4
                 seconds in control dogs to 535+/-82 seconds; P<0.01),
                 similar to the effect of 1 week of RAP (713+/-300
                 seconds). In contrast to RAP, CHF did not alter atrial
                 refractory period, refractoriness heterogeneity, or
                 conduction velocity at a cycle length of 360 ms;
                 however, CHF dogs had a substantial increase in the
                 heterogeneity of conduction during atrial pacing
                 (heterogeneity index in CHF dogs, 2. 76+/-0.16 versus
                 1.46+/-0.10 for control and 1.51+/-0.06 for RAP dogs;
                 P<0.01) owing to discrete regions of slow conduction.
                 Histological examination revealed extensive
                 interstitial fibrosis (connective tissue occupying
                 12.8+/-1.9\% of the cross-sectional area) in CHF dogs

                 9+/-0.2\%) dogs. CONCLUSIONS: Experimental CHF strongly
                 promotes the induction of sustained AF by causing
                 interstitial fibrosis that interferes with local
                 conduction. The substrates of AF in CHF are very
                 different from those of atrial tachycardia-related AF,

                 subjects to acquire dynamic contrast-enhanced images

                 followed by acquisition of 4-5 slices after a delay of ~40

                 of simulation results. A key feature of the Virtual
                 Cell is that it permits the incorporation of realistic
                 experimental geometries within full 3D spatial models.
                 An intuitive JAVA interface allows access via a web
                 browser and includes options for database access,
                 geometry definition (including directly from microscope
                 images), specification of compartment topology, species
                 definition and assignment, chemical reaction input and
                 computational mesh. The system is designed for cell
                 biologists to aid both the interpretation and the
                 planning of experiments. It also contains sophisticated
                 modelling tools that are appropriate for the needs of
                 mathematical biologists. Thus, communication between
                 these traditionally separate scientific communities can
                 be facilitated. This paper will describe the status of

  robnote =      "OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study was to enhance
                 understanding of the working mechanism of cardiac
                 resynchronization therapy by comparing animal
                 experimental, clinical, and computational data on the
                 hemodynamic and electromechanical consequences of left
                 ventricular pacing (LVP) and biventricular pacing (BiVP).
                 BACKGROUND: It is unclear why LVP and BiVP have
                 comparative positive effects on hemodynamic function of
                 patients with dyssynchronous heart failure. METHODS:
                 Hemodynamic response to LVP and BiVP (\% change in maximal
                 rate of left ventricular pressure rise [LVdP/dtmax]) was
                 measured in 6 dogs and 24 patients with heart failure and
                 left bundle branch block followed by computer simulations
                 of local myofiber mechanics during LVP and BiVP in the
                 failing heart with left bundle branch block.
                 Pacing-induced changes of electrical activation were
                 measured in dogs using contact mapping and in patients
                 using a noninvasive multielectrode electrocardiographic
                 mapping technique. RESULTS: LVP and BiVP similarly
                 increased LVdP/dtmax in dogs and in patients, but only
                 BiVP significantly decreased electrical dyssynchrony. In
                 the simulations, LVP and BiVP increased total ventricular
                 myofiber work to the same extent. While the LVP-induced
                 increase was entirely due to enhanced right ventricular
                 (RV) myofiber work, the BiVP-induced increase was due to
                 enhanced myofiber work of both the left ventricle (LV) and
                 RV. Overall, LVdP/dtmax correlated better with total
                 ventricular myofiber work than with LV or RV myofiber work
                 alone. CONCLUSIONS: Animal experimental, clinical, and
                 computational data support the similarity of hemodynamic
                 response to LVP and BiVP, despite differences in
                 electrical dyssynchrony. The simulations provide the novel
                 insight that, through ventricular interaction, the RV
                 myocardium importantly contributes to the improvement in
                 LV pump function induced by cardiac resynchronization
                 therapy.",

  Abstract	= "We present a novel approach for joint clustering and
                   point-by-point mapping of white matter fiber pathways.
		   Knowledge of the point correspondence along the fiber
		   pathways is not only necessary for accurate  clustering of
		   the trajectories into fiber bundles, but also crucial for
		   any tract-oriented quantitative analysis. We employ an
		   expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm to cluster the
		   trajectories in a gamma mixture model context. The result of
		   clustering is the probabilistic assignment of the fiber
		   trajectories to each cluster, an estimate of the cluster
		   parameters, i.e. spatial mean and variance, and point
		   correspondences. The fiber bundles are modeled by the mean
		   trajectory and its spatial variation. Point-by-point
		   correspondence of the trajectories within a bundle is
		   obtained by constructing a distance map and a label map from
		   each cluster center at every iteration of the EM
		   algorithm. This offers a time-efficient alternative to
		   pairwise curve matching of all trajectories with respect to
		   each cluster center. The proposed method has the potential
		   to benefit from an anatomical atlas of fiber tracts by
		   incorporating it as prior information in the EM
		   algorithm. The algorithm is also capable of handling
		   outliers in a principled way. The presented results confirm
		   the efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed framework
		   for quantitative analysis of diffusion tensor MRI.",

                 be a benign type or an early stage of the disease.
                 OBJECTIVE: This study sought to compare the left atrium
                 (LA) substrate using delayed-enhanced magnetic resonance
                 imaging (DE-MRI) in patients with lone AF versus those
                 with comorbidities. METHODS: Forty of 333 included
                 patients met criteria for lone AF. All patients underwent
                 DE-MRI to quantify atrial fibrosis as a marker for
                 structural remodeling (SRM) and underwent catheter
                 ablation. Based on the degree of SRM, patients were staged
                 into 4 groups: Utah I (</=5\% LA wall enhancement), Utah
                 II (>5\% to </=20\%), Utah III (>20\% to </=35\%), or Utah
                 IV (>35\%). RESULTS: Distribution in Utah I to IV was
                 comparable in patients with lone AF and non-lone AF. In
                 both groups, a number of patients showed extensive SRM.
                 Mean enhancement (14.08 +/- 8.94 vs. 16.94 +/- 11.37) was
                 not significantly different between the 2 groups (P =
                 .0721). In the lone AF group, catheter ablation was
                 successful in suppressing AF in all of Utah I, 81.82\% of
                 Utah II, 62.5\% of Utah III, and none of Utah IV patients.
                 Similar results were achieved in the non-lone AF group.
                 Outcome after ablation was significantly dependent on the
                 SRM of the LA (P < .001). CONCLUSION: The degree of LA
                 structural remodeling as detected using DE-MRI is
                 independent of AF type and associated comorbidities.
                 Selecting appropriate treatment candidates based on the
                 quality and quantity of atrial fibrosis using DE-MRI would
                 improve procedural outcome and avoid unnecessary
                 intervention.",

                 veins (PV) isolation using the circular mapping
                 technique. BACKGROUND: Electrical isolation of the PVs
                 in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) remains a
                 technical challenge. METHODS: Two hundred eleven
                 patients (163 men; mean age 53 +/- 11 years) with
                 symptomatic AF were included in this study. In the
                 first 21 patients (group 1), distal isolation (> or = 5
                 mm from the ostium) was achieved targeting veins
                 triggering AF. In the remaining 190 patients (group 2),
                 ostial isolation of all PVs was performed using 4-mm
                 tip (47 patients), 8-mm tip (21 patients), or
                 cooled-tip (122 patients) ablation catheters. RESULTS:
                 Distal isolation was able to eliminate premature atrial
                 contractions (PACs) and AF in six of 21 patients (29\%)
                 and 10 of 34 PVs. After a mean follow-up time of 6 +/-
                 4 months, no patients treated with the 8-mm tip
                 catheter experienced recurrence of AF, whereas 21\% (10
                 of 47 patients) and 15\% (18 of 122 patients) of the
                 patients ablated with the 4-mm tip and the cooled-tip
                 ablation catheters experienced recurrence of AF after a
                 mean follow-up of 10 +/- 3 and 4 +/- 2 months,
                 respectively. Significant complications including
                 stroke, tamponade, and severe stenosis occurred in
                 3.5\% (8/211) of patients. CONCLUSIONS: Catheter
                 technologies designed to achieve better lesion size
                 appeared to have a positive impact on procedure time,
                 fluoroscopy time, number of lesions, and overall
                 efficacy. Although distal isolation can be achieved
                 with fewer lesions, ostial isolation is required in the
                 majority of patients to eliminate arrhythmogenic PACs
                 and AF.",

                 mapping-guided radiofrequency ablation (RFA) of
                 inappropriate sinus tachycardia (IST). Change in
                 activation after the administration of esmolol was also
                 assessed and compared to the shift documented with
                 successful sinus node (SN) modification. BACKGROUND:
                 The long-term results after RFA of IST have been
                 reported to vary between 27\% and 66\%. METHODS:
                 Thirty-nine patients (35 women, mean age 31 +/- 9
                 years) with debilitating IST were included in the
                 study. The area around the earliest site of activation
                 recorded using the 3-D mapping system was targeted for
                 ablation. The shift in the earliest activation site
                 after administration of esmolol was compared with the
                 shift after RFA. RESULTS: The heart rate at rest and in
                 drug-free state ranged between 95 and 125 beats/min
                 (mean 99 +/- 14 beats/min). Sinus node was successfully
                 modified in all patients. Following ablation, the mean
                 heart rate dropped to 72 +/- 8 beats/min, p < 0.01. The
                 extent of the 3-D shift in caudal activation along the
                 crista terminalis was more pronounced after RFA than
                 during esmolol administration (23 +/- 11 mm vs. 7 +/- 5
                 mm, respectively, p < 0.05). No patient required
                 pacemaker implantation after a mean follow-up time of
                 32 +/- 9 months; 21\% of patients experienced
                 recurrence of IST and were successfully re-ablated.
                 CONCLUSIONS: Three-dimensional electroanatomical
                 mapping seems to facilitate and improve the ablation
                 results of IST. The difference in caudal shift seen
                 after esmolol administration and following SN
                 modification suggests that adrenergic hypersensitivity
                 is not the only mechanism responsible for the
                 inappropriate behavior of the SN.",

                 on visualization of microbubbles by ICE (group 3, 152
                 patients). After a mean follow-up time of 417+/-145
                 days, 19.6\% (11 of 56), 16.8\% (18 of 107), and 9.8\%
                 (15 of 152) of patients in groups 1, 2, and 3
                 experienced recurrence of AF, respectively. Moreover,
                 whereas no group 3 patient experienced severe (>70\%)
                 PV stenosis, severe PV stenosis was documented in 3
                 (3.5\%) of 56 patients in group 1 and in 2 (1.8\%) of
                 107 patients in group 2 (P<0.05). No embolic events
                 were detected in group 3 patients. CONCLUSIONS:
                 Intracardiac echocardiography improves the outcome of
                 cooled-tip PVI. Power adjustment guided by direct
                 visualization of microbubble formation reduces the risk
                 of PV stenosis and improves long-term cure.",

                 ablation of typical right atrial flutter (AFL) using
                 different ablation technologies. METHODS: One hundred
                 and two patients presenting for treatment of AFL to our
                 laboratory were included in the study. Based on
                 availability and physician preference, ablation was
                 performed with either a cooled-tip catheter (39
                 patients, group I), an 8- or 10-mm tip catheter
                 connected to a high-power radiofrequency (RF) generator
                 (25 patients, group II), or a 4- or 5-mm tip catheter
                 (38 patients, group III). Acute ablation success was
                 achieved in all group II and group III patients. Among
                 the 38 patients undergoing ablation with the
                 conventional catheter tip (group I), crossover to an
                 8-mm tip or a cooled tip ablation catheter was required
                 in 11 patients (29\%). The mean fluoroscopy time was
                 significantly higher in group I (54.3 +/- 26.4 minutes)
                 when compared to group II (39.6 +/- 19.6 minutes; P <
                 0.05) and group III (40 +/- 16 minutes; P = 0.0.5).
                 After a mean follow up of 20 +/- 5 months no patient in
                 group II experienced recurrence of AFL, whereas 18.4\%

                 39 patients; P < 0.05) in group III had recurrence of
                 AFL. Ablation technologies designed to obtain larger
                 size lesions appeared to be more effective in achieving
                 acute ablation success of AFL and in limiting the
                 long-term recurrence rate of this arrhythmia.",

                 fibrillation (VF) storm in patients with ischemic
                 cardiomyopathy (ICM) and the results of targeted
                 ablation to treat VF storm. BACKGROUND: Monomorphic
                 premature ventricular contractions (PVCs) have been
                 shown to initiate VF in patients without structural
                 heart disease. METHODS: A total of 29 patients with ICM
                 and documented VF initiation were identified. In 21
                 patients, VF storm was controlled with antiarrhythmic
                 drugs and/or treatment of heart failure. Eight patients
                 with VF (mean 52 +/- 25 episodes) refractory to medical
                 management required ablation. All patients underwent
                 three-dimensional electroanatomical mapping using CARTO
                 (Biosense-Webster Inc., Diamond Bar, California), and
                 PVCs were mapped when present. Scarred areas were
                 identified using voltage mapping. RESULTS: Monomorphic
                 PVCs initiated VF in all 29 identified patients. Five
                 of eight patients requiring ablation had frequent PVCs
                 that allowed PVC mapping. The earliest activation site
                 was consistently located in the scar border zone. The
                 PVCs were always preceded by a Purkinje-like potential
                 (PLP). Ablation was successfully performed at these
                 sites. In three patients, infrequent PVCs prevented
                 mapping, but PLPs were recorded around the scar border.
                 Ablation targeting these potentials along the scar
                 border was successfully performed. During follow-up (10
                 +/- 6 months), one patient had a single VF episode and
                 another developed sustained, monomorphic ventricular
                 tachycardia. There was no recurrence of VF storm.
                 CONCLUSIONS: Ventricular fibrillation in ICM is
                 triggered by monomorphic PVCs originating from the scar
                 border zone with preceding PLPs; targeting these PVCs
                 may prevent VF recurrence. In the absence of PVCs, both
                 substrate mapping and ablation appear to be equally
                 effective.",

                 with atrial fibrillation (AF). Extensive atrial tissue
                 fibrosis identified by delayed enhancement magnetic
                 resonance imaging (MRI) has been associated with poor
                 outcomes of AF catheter ablation. OBJECTIVE: To
                 characterize the feasibility of atrial tissue fibrosis
                 estimation by delayed enhancement MRI and its association
                 with subsequent AF ablation outcome. DESIGN, SETTING, AND
                 PARTICIPANTS: Multicenter, prospective, observational
                 cohort study of patients diagnosed with paroxysmal and
                 persistent AF (undergoing their first catheter ablation)
                 conducted between August 2010 and August 2011 at 15
                 centers in the United States, Europe, and Australia.
                 Delayed enhancement MRI images were obtained up to 30 days
                 before ablation. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Fibrosis
                 quantification was performed at a core laboratory blinded
                 to the participating center, ablation approach, and
                 procedure outcome. Fibrosis blinded to the treating
                 physicians was categorized as stage 1 (<10\% of the atrial
                 wall), 2 (>/=10\%-<20\%), 3 (>/=20\%-<30\%), and 4
                 (>/=30\%). Patients were followed up for recurrent
                 arrhythmia per current guidelines using
                 electrocardiography or ambulatory monitor recording and
                 results were analyzed at a core laboratory. Cumulative
                 incidence of recurrence was estimated by stage at days 325
                 and 475 after a 90-day blanking period (standard time
                 allowed for arrhythmias related to ablation-induced
                 inflammation to subside) and the risk of recurrence was
                 estimated (adjusting for 10 demographic and clinical
                 covariates). RESULTS: Atrial tissue fibrosis estimation by
                 delayed enhancement MRI was successfully quantified in 272
                 of 329 enrolled patients (57 patients [17\%] were excluded
                 due to poor MRI quality). There were 260 patients who were
                 followed up after the blanking period (mean [SD] age of
                 59.1 [10.7] years, 31.5\% female, 64.6\% with paroxysmal
                 AF). For recurrent arrhythmia, the unadjusted overall
                 hazard ratio per 1\% increase in left atrial fibrosis was
                 1.06 (95\% CI, 1.03-1.08; P < .001). Estimated unadjusted
                 cumulative incidence of recurrent arrhythmia by day 325
                 for stage 1 fibrosis was 15.3\% (95\% CI, 7.6\%-29.6\%);
                 stage 2, 32.6\% (95\% CI, 24.3\%-42.9\%); stage 3, 45.9\%
                 (95\% CI, 35.5\%-57.5\%); and stage 4, 51.1\% (95\% CI,
                 32.8\%-72.2\%) and by day 475 was 15.3\% (95\% CI,
                 7.6\%-29.6\%), 35.8\% (95\% CI, 26.2\%-47.6\%), 45.9\%
                 (95\% CI, 35.6\%-57.5\%), and 69.4\% (95\% CI,
                 48.6\%-87.7\%), respectively. Similar results were
                 obtained after covariate adjustment. The addition of
                 fibrosis to a recurrence prediction model that includes
                 traditional clinical covariates resulted in an improved
                 predictive accuracy with the C statistic increasing from
                 0.65 to 0.69 (risk difference of 0.05; 95\% CI,
                 0.01-0.09). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Among patients with
                 AF undergoing catheter ablation, atrial tissue fibrosis
                 estimated by delayed enhancement MRI was independently
                 associated with likelihood of recurrent arrhythmia. The
                 clinical implications of this association warrant further
                 investigation.",

                 effects of fiber orientation and transmural location on
                 the relationships between regional myocardial flow and
                 three-dimensional systolic wall strain during graded
                 coronary artery occlusions. METHODS: Transmural
                 distributions of three-dimensional strain (by biplane
                 radiography of implanted radiopaque markers) and
                 myocardial blood flows (using fluorescent microspheres)
                 were measured in the ischemic region during graded left
                 anterior descending (LAD) coronary artery occlusions in
                 12 anesthetized dogs. RESULTS: Occlusion of the
                 coronary artery did not significantly alter mean heart
                 rate or end-systolic pressure. As flow decreased during
                 graded occlusions, ischemia significantly changed
                 systolic circumferential, longitudinal, radial, fiber
                 and cross-fiber strains (p < 0.004). There was a
                 significant effect of transmural position on
                 circumferential, cross-fiber and radial strains, but
                 not on fiber or longitudinal strains. Ischemia
                 significantly altered all normal strains:
                 circumferential, longitudinal, fiber, cross-fiber and
                 radial. There was a strong interaction effect between
                 transmural location and blood flow for circumferential,
                 cross-fiber and radial strains, but not fiber or
                 longitudinal strains. CONCLUSION: During non-transmural
                 ischemia, there is evidence of strong transmural
                 tethering in the cross-fiber direction, whereas the
                 fiber-strain flow relation is independent of transmural
                 position. Thus, whether the relationship between local
                 myocardial bloodflow and systolic strain during acute
                 ischemia is dependent on transmural location, depends
                 on segment orientation.",

                 myofibroblasts (Mfbs) among themselves and with myocytes
                 via gap junctions. We use a magnetic resonance
                 imaging-based, three-dimensional computational model of
                 the chronically infarcted rabbit ventricles to
                 characterize the arrhythmogenic substrate resulting from
                 Mfb infiltration as a function of Mfb density. Mfbs
                 forming gap junctions were incorporated into both infarct
                 regions, the periinfarct zone (PZ) and the scar; six
                 scenarios were modeled: 0\%, 10\%, and 30\% Mfbs in the
                 PZ, with either 80\% or 0\% Mfbs in the scar. Ionic
                 current remodeling in PZ was also included. All
                 preparations exhibited elevated resting membrane potential
                 within and near the PZ and action potential duration
                 shortening throughout the ventricles. The unique
                 combination of PZ ionic current remodeling and different
                 degrees of Mfb infiltration in the infarcted ventricles
                 determines susceptibility to arrhythmia. At low densities,
                 Mfbs do not alter arrhythmia propensity; the latter arises
                 predominantly from ionic current remodeling in PZ. At
                 intermediate densities, Mfbs cause additional action
                 potential shortening and exacerbate arrhythmia propensity.
                 At high densities, Mfbs protect against arrhythmia by
                 causing resting depolarization and blocking propagation,
                 thus overcoming the arrhythmogenic effects of PZ ionic
                 current remodeling.",

                 by which fibrosis underlies the degradation of a pulmonary

                 provide a proof-of-concept that patient-specific virtual
                 electrophysiological study that combines i) atrial
                 structure and fibrosis distribution from clinical MRI and
                 ii) modeling of atrial electrophysiology, could be used to
                 predict: (1) how fibrosis distribution determines the
                 locations from which paced beats degrade into AF; (2) the
                 dynamic behavior of persistent AF rotors; and (3) the
                 optimal ablation targets in each patient. Four MRI-based
                 patient-specific models of fibrotic left atria were
                 generated, ranging in fibrosis amount. Virtual
                 electrophysiological studies were performed in these
                 models, and where AF was inducible, the dynamics of AF
                 were used to determine the ablation locations that render
                 AF non-inducible. In 2 of the 4 models patient-specific
                 models AF was induced; in these models the distance
                 between a given pacing location and the closest fibrotic
                 region determined whether AF was inducible from that
                 particular location, with only the mid-range distances
                 resulting in arrhythmia. Phase singularities of persistent
                 rotors were found to move within restricted regions of
                 tissue, which were independent of the pacing location from
                 which AF was induced. Electrophysiological sensitivity
                 analysis demonstrated that these regions changed little
                 with variations in electrophysiological parameters.
                 Patient-specific distribution of fibrosis was thus found
                 to be a critical component of AF initiation and
                 maintenance. When the restricted regions encompassing the
                 meander of the persistent phase singularities were modeled
                 as ablation lesions, AF could no longer be induced. The
                 study demonstrates that a patient-specific modeling
                 approach to identify non-invasively AF ablation targets
                 prior to the clinical procedure is feasible.",

                  (IPA) and the association with permanent scar 3 months
                  post-ablation (3moPA).  Heterogeneous injuries with HE and NE
                  regions were identified in all patients. Dark NE regions in
                  the left atrial wall on LGE MRI demonstrate findings similar
                  to the no-reflow phenomenon. Although the left atrial wall
                  showed similar amounts of HE, NE, and normal tissue IPA (37.7
                  +/- 13\%, 34.3 +/- 14\%, and 28.0 +/- 11\%, respectively; p =
                  NS), registration of IPA injuries with 3moPA scarring
                  demonstrated that 59.0 +/- 19\% of scar resulted from NE
                  tissue, 30.6 +/- 15\% from HE tissue, and 10.4 +/- 5\% from
                  tissue identified as normal.  Paired t-test comparisons were
                  all statistically significant among NE, HE, and normal tissue
                  types (p < 0.001). Arrhythmia recurrence at 1-year follow-up
                  correlated with the degree of wall enhancement 3moPA (p =
                  0.02). CONCLUSIONS: Radiofrequency ablation results in
                  heterogeneous injury on LGE MRI with both HE and NE wall
                  lesions. The NE lesions demonstrate no-reflow characteristics
                  and reveal a better predictor of final scar at 3 months. Scar
                  correlates with procedure outcomes, further highlighting the
                  importance of early scar prediction.",

                 valve in the beating heart via direct apical access in
                 eight porcine hearts. A clinical stentless bioprosthetic
                 valve affixed to a platinum stent was compressed onto a
                 balloon-tipped catheter. This was fed through a 15-18-mm
                 delivery port inserted into the left ventricular (LV) apex
                 via a minimally invasive subxyphoid incision. Using

                 cardiac denervation for its prevention. METHODS:
                 Patients undergoing low-risk coronary artery surgery
                 had ventral cardiac denervation performed in 207
                 patients, and 219 patients were used as control
                 subjects. RESULTS: The additional time for the
                 denervation was 5 +/- 2 minutes, and there were no
                 associated complications. Postoperative atrial
                 fibrillation was present in 15 (7\%) patients
                 undergoing ventral cardiac denervation (95\% confidence
                 interval, 4\%-12\%) and in 56 (27\%) control subjects
                 (95\% confidence interval, 18\%-35\%). Patients
                 submitted to ventral cardiac denervation had fewer and
                 less severe episodes of atrial fibrillation, and no

                 epicardium from measured electrocardiograms (ECGs) on the
                 torso surface. The main challenge of solving this
                 electrocardiographic imaging (ECGI) problem lies in its
                 intrinsic ill-posedness. While many regularization
                 techniques have been developed to control wild
                 oscillations of the solution, the choice of proper
                 regularization methods for obtaining clinically acceptable
                 solutions is still a subject of ongoing research. However
                 there has been little rigorous comparison across methods
                 proposed by different groups. This study systematically
                 compared various regularization techniques for solving the
                 ECGI problem under a unified simulation framework,
                 consisting of both 1) progressively more complex idealized
                 source models (from single dipole to triplet of dipoles),
                 and 2) an electrolytic human torso tank containing a live
                 canine heart, with the cardiac source being modeled by
                 potentials measured on a cylindrical cage placed around
                 the heart. We tested 13 different regularization
                 techniques to solve the inverse problem of recovering
                 epicardial potentials, and found that non-quadratic
                 methods (total variation algorithms) and first-order and
                 second-order Tikhonov regularizations outperformed other

                 repolarization that predisposes affected individuals to
                 lethal arrhythmias. Acquired LQT is far more common and
                 is most often caused by block of cardiac HERG K(+)
                 channels by commonly used medications. It is unclear
                 why so many structurally diverse compounds block HERG
                 channels, but this undesirable side effect now is
                 recognized as a major hurdle in the development of new
                 and safe drugs. Here we use alanine-scanning
                 mutagenesis to determine the structural basis for
                 high-affinity drug block of HERG channels by MK-499, a
                 methanesulfonanilide antiarrhythmic drug. The

                 prokinetic drug, cisapride, interact with Y652 and
                 F656, but not with V625. The aromatic residues of the
                 S6 domain that interact with these drugs (Y652 and
                 F656) are unique to eag/erg K(+) channels. Other
                 voltage-gated K(+) (Kv) channels have Ile and Val (Ile)
                 in the equivalent positions. These findings suggest a
                 possible structural explanation for how so many
                 commonly used medications block HERG but not other Kv
                 channels and should facilitate the rational design of

                 trends in AF incidence for 1980 to 2000 and provided
                 prevalence projections to 2050. METHODS AND RESULTS: The
                 adult residents of Olmsted County, Minnesota, who had
                 ECG-confirmed first AF in the period 1980 to 2000 (n=4618)
                 were identified. Trends in age-adjusted incidence were
                 determined and used to construct model-based prevalence
                 estimates. The age- and sex-adjusted incidence of AF per
                 1000 person-years was 3.04 (95\% CI, 2.78 to 3.31) in 1980
                 and 3.68 (95\% CI, 3.42 to 3.95) in 2000. According to
                 Poisson regression with adjustment for age and sex,
                 incidence of AF increased significantly (P=0.014), with a
                 relative increase of 12.6\% (95\% CI, 2.1 to 23.1) over 21
                 years. The increase in age-adjusted AF incidence did not
                 differ between men and women (P=0.84). According to the US
                 population projections by the US Census Bureau, the number
                 of persons with AF is projected to be 12.1 million by
                 2050, assuming no further increase in age-adjusted
                 incidence of AF, but 15.9 million if the increase in
                 incidence continues. CONCLUSIONS: The age-adjusted
                 incidence of AF increased significantly in Olmsted County
                 during 1980 to 2000. Whether or not this rate of increase
                 continues, the projected number of persons with AF for the
                 United States will exceed 10 million by 2050, underscoring
                 the urgent need for primary prevention strategies against
                 AF development.",

                 fibrillation (AF), the development of chronic
                 nonvalvular AF models has been difficult. Animal models
                 of sustained AF have been developed primarily in the
                 short-term setting. Recently, models of chronic
                 ventricular myopathy and fibrillation have been
                 developed after several weeks of continuous rapid
                 ventricular pacing. We hypothesized that chronic rapid
                 atrial pacing would lead to atrial myopathy, yielding a
                 reproducible model of sustained AF. METHODS AND
                 RESULTS: Twenty-two halothane-anesthetized mongrel dogs
                 underwent insertion of a transvenous lead at the right
                 atrial appendage that was continuously paced at 400
                 beats per minute for 6 weeks. Two-dimensional
                 echocardiography was performed in 11 dogs to assess the
                 effects of rapid atrial pacing on atrial size. Marked
                 biatrial enlargement was documented; after 6 weeks of
                 continuous rapid atrial pacing, the left atrium was 7.8
                 +/- 1 cm2 at baseline versus 11.3 +/- 1 cm2 after
                 pacing, and the right atrium was 4.3 +/- 0.7 cm2 at
                 baseline versus 7.2 +/- 1.3 cm2 after pacing. An
                 increase in atrial area of at least 40\% was necessary
                 to induce sustained AF and was strongly correlated with
                 the inducibility of AF (r =.87). Electron microscopy of
                 atrial tissue demonstrated structural changes that were
                 characterized by an increase in mitochondrial size and
                 number and by disruption of the sarcoplasmic reticulum.
                 After 6 weeks of continuous rapid atrial pacing,
                 sustained AF was induced in 18 dogs (82\%) and
                 nonsustained AF was induced in 2 dogs (9\%). AF
                 occurred spontaneously in 4 dogs (18\%). Right atrial
                 ERP, measured at cycle lengths of 400 and 300
                 milliseconds at baseline, was significantly shortened
                 after pacing, from 150 +/- 8 to 127 +/- 10 milliseconds
                 and from 147 +/- 11 to 123 +/- 12 milliseconds,
                 respectively (P <.001). This finding was highly
                 predictive of inducibility of AF (90\%). Increased
                 atrial area (40\%) and ERP shortening were highly
                 predictive for the induction of sustained AF (88\%).
                 Local epicardial ERP correlated well with local AFCL
                 (R2 =.93). Mean AFCL was significantly shorter in the
                 left atrium (81 +/- 8 milliseconds) compared with the
                 right atrium 94 +/- 9 milliseconds (P <.05). An area in
                 the posterior left atrium was consistently found to
                 have a shorter AFCL (74 +/- 5 milliseconds).
                 Cryoablation of this area was attempted in 11 dogs. In
                 9 dogs (82\%; mean, 9.0 +/- 4.0; range, 5 to 14), AF
                 was terminated and no longer induced after serial
                 cryoablation. CONCLUSIONS: Sustained AF was readily
                 inducible in most dogs (82\%) after rapid atrial
                 pacing. This model was consistently associated with
                 biatrial myopathy and marked changes in atrial
                 vulnerability. An area in the posterior left atrium was
                 uniformly shown to have the shortest AFCL. The results
                 of restoration of sinus rhythm and prevention of
                 inducibility of AF after cryoablation of this area of
                 the left atrium suggest that this area may be critical
                 in the maintenance of AF in this model.",

                 the effect of transmural fiber rotation during bipolar
                 stimulation in three-dimensional (3-D) myocardium. A
                 3-D tissue block with unequal anisotropy and two types
                 of fiber rotation (none and moderate) was stimulated
                 along and across fibers via bipolar electrodes on the
                 epicardial surface, and the resulting steady-state
                 interstitial (phi e) and transmembrane (Vm) potentials

                 rotated fibers does not change the amount of tissue
                 polarized by the point surface stimuli, but does cause
                 changes in the orientation of phi e and Vm in the depth
                 of the tissue, away from the epicardium. Further
                 analysis revealed a relationship between the Laplacian
                 of phi e, regions of virtual electrodes, and fiber
                 orientation that was dependent upon adequacy of spatial
                 sampling and the interstitial anisotropy. These

                 discrimination task in visual and auditory modality,
                 separately. Short durations were used ranging from 500 to
                 900 ms, among which participants had to discriminate a
                 previously memorized 700-ms standard duration. Behavioral
                 results show accurate but variable performance within and
                 between participants with expected modality effects: the
                 percentage of responses was greater and the mean response
                 time was shorter for auditory than for visual signals.
                 Sustained electric and magnetic activities were obtained
                 correlatively to duration estimation, but with distinct
                 spatiotemporal properties. Electric CNV-like potentials
                 showed fronto-central negativity in both modalities,
                 whereas magnetic sustained fields were distributed with
                 respect to the modality of the interval to be timed. Time

                 on the recording signal (EEG or MEG). Source
                 reconstruction demonstrated that these sustained
                 potentials/fields were generated by superimposed
                 contributions from visual and auditory cortices (sustained

                 regions. By using these two complementary techniques, we

                 our understanding of AF (focal activity, single-circuit
                 or mother wave reentry, and multiple circuit reentry)
                 were established based on animal studies almost 100
                 years ago. The past 10 years have witnessed a
                 tremendous acceleration of animal work in this area,
                 including the development of a range of AF models in
                 clinically relevant pathological substrates (eg, atrial
                 tachycardia remodeling, congestive heart failure,
                 pericarditis, ischemic heart disease, mitral valve
                 disease, volume overload states, respiratory failure)
                 and the establishment of an increasing number of
                 genetically defined transgenic mouse models. This
                 article reviews the contribution of animal models to
                 our knowledge about AF mechanisms and to clinical

                 atrial remodeling, as well as the consequent clinical
                 insights into atrial fibrillation pathophysiology and
                 treatment. RECENT FINDINGS: Two principal forms of
                 remodeling have been described in animal models of
                 atrial fibrillation: ionic remodeling, which affects
                 cellular electrical properties, and structural
                 remodeling, which alters atrial tissue architecture.
                 Atrial tachycardias (particularly rapid
                 tachyarrhythmias such as atrial flutter and atrial
                 fibrillation) cause ionic remodeling, which decreases
                 the atrial refractory period and promotes atrial
                 reentry. Congestive heart failure produces atrial
                 interstitial fibrosis, which promotes arrhythmogenesis
                 by interfering with atrial conduction properties.
                 Recent animal studies have provided insights into the
                 pathways involved in remodeling, and have indicated the
                 pathophysiological role of remodeling in specific
                 contexts. In addition, work in animal models has
                 provided information about pharmacological
                 interventions that can prevent the development of
                 remodeling. Clinical studies have shown that novel
                 approaches to remodeling prevention identified in
                 animal work have potential therapeutic value in man.
                 SUMMARY: Understanding atrial remodeling has the
                 potential to improve our appreciation of the
                 pathophysiology of clinical atrial fibrillation and to
                 allow for the development of useful new therapeutic

                 understanding of atrial fibrillation (AF) over the last
                 several years has been the recognition that AF itself
                 modifies atrial electrical properties in a way that
                 promotes the occurrence and maintenance of the
                 arrhythmia, a process termed 'atrial remodeling'. The
                 principle stimulus for AF-induced atrial remodeling is
                 the rapid atrial rate that results: rapid regular
                 atrial pacing produces changes similar to those caused
                 by AF in animal models. The mechanisms of atrial
                 tachycardia-induced remodeling have been extensively
                 explored, and involve changes in atrial
                 electrophysiology associated with altered ion channel
                 function. The most important ionic change is a
                 reduction in L-type Ca2+ current, which reduces action
                 potential duration (APD) and APD adaptation to rate.
                 AF-induced changes in ion channel function appear to be
                 due both to rapid voltage- and time-dependent
                 alterations in channel availability caused by
                 tachycardia and to slower downregulation of messenger
                 RNA concentrations encoding alpha-subunits of specific
                 ion channels. Atrial remodeling likely contributes
                 importantly to a wide variety of clinical phenomena of
                 previously unrecognized mechanism, including atrial
                 dysfunction after cardioversion of AF, the increasing
                 resistance to therapy of longer-standing AF, the
                 association of AF with other forms of supraventricular
                 tachyarrhythmia and the tendency of paroxysmal AF to
                 become chronic. The present paper reviews the state of
                 knowledge regarding the mechanisms and clinical
                 consequences for AF of atrial remodeling caused by
                 rapid atrial activation.",

                 measurements. They show that which feature of the

                 nature of propagation, waveform morphology and
                 orientation of bipolar relatvie to fiber direction and
                 direction of propagation. They suggest that the reason
                 unipolar recordings are not always the best practical
                 tool is that they are so effected by remote events in
                 cases of poor local conduction.",

                 are predictive of motor outcome(s). We tested the
                 hypothesis that the position and trajectory of the DBS
                 lead relative to the mid-commissural point (MCP) are
                 significant predictors of clinical outcomes.

                 magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). 
		 Imaging revealed a significant reduction in
                 LA volumes in AF patients post-PVAI. In the subset of
                 patients with persistent AF, post-PVAI improvements were
                 seen in global (p < 0.01) and regional LA functions (p =
                 0.01). In the paroxysmal AF patients, post-PVAI
                 measurements revealed decreases in LA transport function
                 (p = 0.02) as well as diminished regional function in the
                 LA lateral wall (p = 0.02). The paroxysmal AF patients had
                 global and regional LA functions comparable to the normal
                 volunteers prior to ablation; however, these were
                 significantly diminished post ablation. CONCLUSION:
                 Extensive ablation during PVAI causes mild deterioration
                 in LA function. However, in patients with a high burden of
                 AF, it appears that the positive remodeling that occurs
                 with rhythm restoration outweighs any negative effects of

                 cardiac ganglionated plexi of the autonomic,
                 predominantly vagal nerves. Vagal denervation may
                 improve the success rate of atrial fibrillation (AF)
                 treatment. OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study was to
                 elucidate the long-term effects of fat pad ablation on
                 the electrophysiologic characteristics of the atrium
                 and AF inducibility. METHODS: Six mongrel dogs were
                 studied. Cervical vagal stimulation was applied to
                 determine effects on the sinus node, AV node, atrial
                 effective refractory period (AERP), and AF
                 inducibility. AERP and AF inducibility were evaluated
                 at both the right atrial and left atrial appendages and
                 at the right atrial and left atrial free walls.
                 Radiofrequency energy was delivered epicardially to the
                 entire areas of two major fat pads: right pulmonary
                 vein fat pad and inferior vena cava-left atrium fat
                 pad. Cervical vagal stimulation then was applied to
                 confirm the acute effects of fat pad ablation. The same
                 evaluation was repeated 4 weeks later. RESULTS: The
                 effects of vagal stimulation on the sinus node, AV
                 node, and AERP were significantly eliminated
                 immediately after fat pad ablation. However, these
                 denervation effects disappeared after 4 weeks. At
                 baseline, AF inducibility was increased by vagal
                 stimulation (right atrial appendage: 72\% +/- 31\% vs
                 4.8\% +/- 12\%; right atrial free wall: 75\% +/- 31\%
                 vs 0.0\% +/- 0.0\%; left atrial appendage: 60\% +/-
                 29\% vs 0.0\% +/- 0.0\%; left atrial free wall: 65\%
                 +/- 42\% vs 0.0\% +/- 0.0\%). Fat pad ablation
                 significantly reduced this vagal stimulation effect
                 (8.3\% +/- 20\%, 10\% +/- 22\%, 17\% +/- 29\%, and 25\%
                 +/- 29\%, respectively). However, similar to baseline,
                 AF inducibility was strongly augmented by vagal
                 stimulation 4 weeks after fat pad ablation (96\% +/-
                 10\%, 100\% +/- 0.0\%, 100\% +/- 0.0\%, and 95\% +/-
                 11\%, respectively). CONCLUSION: Radiofrequency fat pad
                 ablation may not achieve long-term suppression of AF
                 induction in this canine model.",

                 segment/heart rate index can improve the accuracy of
                 the exercise electrocardiogram (ECG) for the
                 identification of patients with coronary artery
                 disease, recognition of patients with anatomically or

                 of patients at increased risk for future coronary
                 events. These methods provide a more physiologic
                 approach to analysis of the ST segment response to
                 exercise by adjusting the apparent severity of ischemia
                 for the corresponding increase in myocardial oxygen
                 demand, which in turn can be linearly related to
                 increasing heart rate. Solid-angle theory provides a
                 model for the linear relation of ST segment depression
                 to heart rate during exercise and a framework for
                 understanding the relation of the ST segment/heart rate
                 slope to the presence and extent of coronary artery
                 disease. False positive and false negative test results
                 of the heart rate-adjusted methods are well known in
                 selected populations and require further clarification.
                 Application of these methods is also highly dependent
                 on the type of exercise protocol, number of ECG leads
                 examined, timing of ST segment measurement relative to
                 the J point and accuracy and precision of ST segment
                 measurement. These methodologic details have been an
                 important limitation to test application when
                 traditional protocols and measurement procedures are
                 required. When applied with attention to required
                 details, the heart rate-adjusted methods can improve
                 the usefulness of the exercise ECG in a range of
                 clinically relevant populations.",

                 stratification for the prediction of death from
                 coronary artery disease. BACKGROUND: Standard analysis
                 of the ST segment response to exercise based on a fixed
                 magnitude of horizontal or downsloping ST segment
                 depression has demonstrated only limited diagnostic
                 sensitivity for the detection of coronary artery
                 disease and has variable test performance in predicting
                 coronary artery disease mortality. Heart rate
                 adjustment of the magnitude of ST segment depression
                 has been proposed as an alternative approach to
                 increase the diagnostic and prognostic accuracy of the
                 exercise electrocardiogram (ECG). METHODS: Exercise
                 ECGs were performed in 5,940 men from the Usual Care
                 Group of the Multiple Risk Factor Intervention Trial at
                 entry into the study. An abnormal ST segment response
                 to exercise was defined according to standard criteria
                 as > or = 100 micro V of additional horizontal or
                 downsloping ST segment depression at peak exercise. The
                 ST segment/heart rate index was calculated by dividing
                 the change in ST segment depression from rest to peak
                 exercise by the exercise-induced change in heart rate.
                 An abnormal ST segment/heart rate index was defined as
                 >1.60 micro V/beats per min. RESULTS: After a mean
                 follow-up of 7 years there were 109 coronary artery
                 disease deaths. Using a Cox proportional hazards model,
                 a positive exercise ECG by standard criteria was not

                 70/5211, P=NS). Risk reduction in SI men with an
                 abnormal ST/HR index was independent of age and other
                 cardiac risk factors. In contrast, there was no
                 significant difference in CHD death rate between the
                 smaller groups of SI and UC men with an abnormal test
                 by standard criteria (3.6\%, 7/192 versus 2.7\%, 5/186,
                 P=NS). CONCLUSIONS: An abnormal ST/HR index identifies
                 men in whom therapy aimed at reducing CHD risk factors
                 reduces the risk of CHD death by 61\%. These findings
                 support the application of heart rate adjustment of ST
                 depression for screening of asymptomatic subjects at
                 increased risk of CHD to identify those who will
                 benefit most from risk factor-reduction programs.",

                 representation of the myocardial electric activity is
                 the equivalent double layer. The transfer factors

                 surface were computed using a realistic thorax model.
                 RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: The resulting transfer factors
                 were implemented in a simulation program. The program
                 allows the user to make interactive changes in the

                 width and also less than 25\% of the R wave in depth in

                 noninfarction groups based on their clinical histories
                 and cardiac catheterization data. The infarction group
                 showed characteristic surface maps with a minimum which

                 soft-tissue imaging and no known harmful effects, has the
                 potential as an alternative modality to guide various
                 medical interventions. This review will focus on MR-guided
                 endovascular interventions and present its current state
                 and future outlook. In the first technical part, enabling
                 technologies such as developments in fast imaging,
                 catheter devices, and visualization techniques are
                 examined. This is followed by a clinical survey that
                 includes proof-of-concept procedures in animals and
                 initial experience in human subjects. In preclinical
                 experiments, MRI has already proven to be valuable. For
                 example, MRI has been used to guide and track targeted
                 cell delivery into or around myocardial infarctions, to
                 guide atrial septal puncture, and to guide the connection
                 of portal and systemic venous circulations. Several
                 investigational MR-guided procedures have already been
                 reported in patients, such as MR-guided cardiac
                 catheterization, invasive imaging of peripheral artery
                 atheromata, selective intraarterial MR angiography, and
                 preliminary angioplasty and stent placement. In addition,
                 MR-assisted transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt
                 procedures in patients have been shown in a novel hybrid
                 double-doughnut x-ray/MRI system. Numerous additional
                 investigational human MR-guided endovascular procedures
                 are now underway in several medical centers around the
                 world. There are also significant hurdles: availability of
                 clinical-grade devices, device-related safety issues,
                 challenges to patient monitoring, and acoustic noise
                 during imaging. The potential of endovascular
                 interventional MRI is great because as a single modality,
                 it combines 3-dimensional anatomic imaging, device
                 localization, hemodynamics, tissue composition, and
                 function.",

                 elements are known to influence the electrophysiologic
                 and dynamic properties of the heart. This study
                 describes the regional distribution in the canine atria
                 of electrophysiologic effects induced by stimulation of
                 the right and left cervical vagosympathetic complexes,
                 the right atrial ganglionated plexus, and the right and
                 left stellate ganglia. Local atrial effects were
                 determined from changes in QRST area of unipolar
                 electrograms recorded from multiple sites with plaque
                 electrodes sewn onto the atria in 16 anesthetized dogs.
                 Results: (1) Although being very consistent in any
                 given preparation, atrial changes varied between
                 animals when similar neural structures were stimulated.
                 (2) Among the common features identified between
                 preparations, consistent effects were induced by neural
                 stimulation in the region of the sinus node, indicating
                 that this atrial region is the most richly innervated.
                 (3) All other regions of the atria could be affected by
                 stimulation of either right-sided or left-sided
                 efferent nerves. (4) Responses to right atrial
                 ganglionated plexus stimulation after atropine
                 administration indicated that the corresponding fat pad
                 contains both sympathetic and parasympathetic neural
                 elements. Conclusion: This study demonstrates that
                 there is considerable overlapping of atrial innervation
                 affecting all regions of the atria, as well as the
                 sinus node region.",

                 influential book that reported experiments in which the

                 Alessandro Volta (bimetallic electricity) were used
                 together for the first time. Aldini was born in Bologna in
                 1762 and graduated in physics at the University of his
                 native town in 1782. As nephew and assistant of Galvani,
                 he actively participated in a series of crucial
                 experiments with frog's muscles that led to the idea that
                 electricity was the long-sought vital force coursing from
                 brain to muscles. Aldini became professor of experimental
                 physics at the University of Bologna in 1798. He traveled
                 extensively throughout Europe, spending much time
                 defending the concept of his discreet uncle against the
                 incessant attacks of Volta, who did not believe in animal
                 electricity. Aldini used Volta's bimetallic pile to apply
                 electric current to dismembered bodies of animals and
                 humans; these spectacular galvanic reanimation experiments
                 made a strong and enduring impression on his
                 contemporaries. Aldini also treated patients with
                 personality disorders and reported complete rehabilitation
                 following transcranial administration of electric current.
                 Aldini's work laid the ground for the development of
                 various forms of electrotherapy that were heavily used
                 later in the 19th century. In recognition of his merits, Aldini
                 was made a knight of the Iron Crown and a councillor of
                 state at Milan, where he died in 1834.",

                 235 patients who underwent initial ablation for AF at our
                 institution between August 2011 and December 2012, we
                 retrospectively identified 70 patients who had
                 preprocedural magnetic resonance angiography merged with
                 LA anatomy in EAM software and had a 3-month postablation
                 LGE-MRI for assessment of scar. Ablated area was marked
                 intraprocedurally using EAM software and quantified
                 retrospectively. Scarred area was quantified in 3-month
                 postablation LGE-MRI. The mean ablated area in EAM was
                 30.5 +/- 7.5\% of the LA endocardial surface and the mean
                 scarred area in LGE-MRI was 13.9 +/- 5.9\% (P < 0.001).
                 This significant difference in the ablated area marked in
                 the EAM and scar area in the LGE-MRI was present for each
                 of the 3 independent operators. Complete pulmonary vein

                 37.4\% in LGE-MRI (P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: In AF

                 fibrillation (AF) but the recurrence rate remains high. We
                 explored in this study whether poor scar formation as seen

                 (LGE-MRI) correlates with AF recurrence following
                 ablation. METHODS: We retrospectively identified 94
                 consecutive patients who underwent their initial ablation
                 for AF at our institution and had pre-procedural magnetic
                 resonance angiography (MRA) merged with left atrial (LA)
                 anatomy in an electroanatomic mapping (EAM) system,
                 ablated areas marked intraprocedurally in EAM, 3-month
                 post-ablation LGE-MRI for assessment of scar, and minimum
                 of 3-months of clinical follow-up. Ablated area was
                 quantified retrospectively in EAM and scarred area was
                 quantified in the 3-month post-ablation LGE-MRI. RESULTS:
                 With the mean follow-up of 336 days, 26 out of 94 patients
                 had AF recurrence. Age, hypertension, and heart failure
                 were not associated with AF recurrence, but LA size and
                 difference between EAM ablated area and LGE-MRI scar area
                 was associated with higher AF recurrence. For each percent
                 higher difference between EAM ablated area and LGE-MRI
                 scar area, there was a 7-9 \% higher AF recurrence (p
                 values 0.001-0.003) depending on the multivariate
                 analysis. CONCLUSIONS: In AF ablation, poor scar formation
                 as seen on LGE-MRI was associated with AF recurrence.
                 Improved mapping and ablation techniques are necessary to
                 achieve the desired LA scar and reduce AF recurrence.",

                 imaging. It is found, as expected, that variations in

                 corresponding T1 image. The potential use of NMR T1

                 the temperature could be either known or directly
                 controlled with reasonable accuracy, images are
                 obtained with samples having at least two regions at
                 different temperatures. As expected, T1 is found to
                 vary linearly with 1/T over the range of 0 degrees C to
                 about 40 degrees C for blood. The potential use of T1

                 fibrous structure is paramount in understanding the
                 mechanisms of atrial electric function in health and
                 disease. Thus far, such knowledge has been acquired from
                 destructive sectioning, and there is a paucity of data
                 about atrial fiber architecture variability in the human
                 population. METHODS AND RESULTS: In this study, we have
                 developed a customized 3-dimensional diffusion tensor
                 magnetic resonance imaging sequence on a clinical scanner
                 that makes it possible to image an entire intact human
                 heart specimen ex vivo at submillimeter resolution. The
                 data from 8 human atrial specimens obtained with this
                 technique present complete maps of the fibrous
                 organization of the human atria. The findings demonstrate
                 that the main features of atrial anatomy are mostly
                 preserved across subjects although the exact location and
                 orientation of atrial bundles vary. Using the full
                 tractography data, we were able to cluster, visualize, and
                 characterize the distinct major bundles in the human
                 atria. Furthermore, quantitative characterization of the
                 fiber angles across the atrial wall revealed that the
                 transmural fiber angle distribution is heterogeneous
                 throughout different regions of the atria. CONCLUSIONS:
                 The application of submillimeter diffusion tensor magnetic
                 resonance imaging provides an unprecedented level of
                 information on both human atrial structure, as well as its
                 intersubject variability. The high resolution and fidelity
                 of this data could enhance our understanding of structural
                 contributions to atrial rhythm and pump disorders and lead
                 to improvements in their targeted treatment.",

                 infarct structure and fiber orientation remodeling is
                 essential for complete understanding of infarct
                 pathophysiology and post-infarction electromechanical
                 functioning of the heart. Accurate imaging of infarct
                 microstructure necessitates imaging techniques that
                 produce high image spatial resolution and high
                 signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). The aim of this study is to
                 provide detailed reconstruction of 3D chronic infarcts in
                 order to characterize the infarct microstructural
                 remodeling in porcine and human hearts. METHODS: We
                 employed a customized diffusion tensor imaging (DTI)
                 technique in conjunction with late gadolinium enhancement
                 (LGE) cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) on a 3T
                 clinical scanner to image, at submillimeter resolution,
                 myofiber orientation and scar structure in eight
                 chronically infarcted porcine hearts ex vivo. Systematic
                 quantification of local microstructure was performed and
                 the chronic infarct remodeling was characterized at
                 different levels of wall thickness and scar transmurality.
                 Further, a human heart with myocardial infarction was
                 imaged using the same DTI sequence. RESULTS: The SNR of
                 non-diffusion-weighted images was >100 in the infarcted
                 and control hearts. Mean diffusivity and fractional
                 anisotropy (FA) demonstrated a 43\% increase, and a 35\%
                 decrease respectively, inside the scar tissue. Despite
                 this, the majority of the scar showed anisotropic
                 structure with FA higher than an isotropic liquid. The
                 analysis revealed that the primary eigenvector orientation
                 at the infarcted wall on average followed the pattern of
                 original fiber orientation (imbrication angle mean: 1.96
                 +/- 11.03 degrees vs. 0.84 +/- 1.47 degrees , p = 0.61,
                 and inclination angle range: 111.0 +/- 10.7 degrees vs.
                 112.5 +/- 6.8 degrees , p = 0.61, infarcted/control wall),
                 but at a higher transmural gradient of inclination angle
                 that increased with scar transmurality (r = 0.36) and the
                 inverse of wall thickness (r = 0.59). Further, the
                 infarcted wall exhibited a significant increase in both
                 the proportion of left-handed epicardial eigenvectors, and
                 in the angle incoherency. The infarcted human heart
                 demonstrated preservation of primary eigenvector
                 orientation at the thinned region of infarct, consistent
                 with the findings in the porcine hearts. CONCLUSIONS: The
                 application of high-resolution DTI and LGE-CMR revealed
                 the detailed organization of anisotropic infarct structure
                 at a chronic state. This information enhances our
                 understanding of chronic post-infarction remodeling in
                 large animal and human hearts.",

                 studied in computer simulations and in thin
                 (approximately 20 x 20 x 0.5-mm) slices of dog and
                 sheep ventricular epicardial muscle. A two-dimensional
                 matrix consisting of 96 x 96 electrically coupled cells
                 modeled by the FitzHugh-Nagumo equations was used to
                 analyze the dynamics of self-sustaining reentrant
                 activity in the form of elliptical spiral waves induced
                 by premature stimulation. In homogeneous anisotropic
                 media, spirals are stationary and may last
                 indefinitely. However, the presence of small parameter
                 gradients may lead to drifting and eventual termination
                 of the spiral at the boundary of the medium. On the
                 other hand, spirals may anchor and rotate around small
                 discontinuities within the matrix. Similar results were
                 obtained experimentally in 10 preparations whose
                 electrical activity was monitored by means of a
                 potentiometric dye and high-resolution optical mapping
                 techniques; premature stimulation triggered
                 reproducible episodes of sustained or nonsustained
                 reentrant tachycardia in the form of spiral waves. As a
                 rule, the spirals were elongated, with the major
                 hemiaxis parallel to the longitudinal axis of the
                 cells. The period of rotation (183 +/- 68 msec [mean
                 +/- SD]) was longer than the refractory period (131 +/-
                 38 msec) and appeared to be determined by the size of
                 the spiral's core, which was measured using a newly
                 devised frame-stack plot. Drifting of spiral waves was
                 also observed experimentally. Drift velocity was 9.8\%
                 of the velocity of wave propagation. In some cases, the
                 core became stationary by anchoring to small arteries
                 or other heterogeneities, and the spiral rotated
                 rhythmically for prolonged periods of time. Yet, when
                 drift occurred, spatiotemporal variations in the
                 excitation period were manifested as a result of a
                 Doppler effect, with the excitation period ahead of the
                 core being 20 +/- 6\% shorter than the excitation
                 period behind the core. As a result of these coexisting
                 frequencies, a pseudoelectrocardiogram of the activity
                 in the presence of a drifting spiral wave exhibited QRS
                 complexes with an undulating axis, which resembled
                 those observed in patients with torsade de pointes. The
                 overall results show that spiral wave activity is a
                 property of cardiac muscle and suggest that such
                 activity may be the common mechanism of a number of
                 monomorphic and polymorphic tachycardias.",

                 each PV was quantitatively (volume of scar) and
                 qualitatively (1: minimal, 3: extensive and
                 circumferential) assessed. RESULTS: Thirteen (37\%)
                 patients had recurrent AF during the 6.7 +/- 3.6-month
                 observation period. Paroxysmal AF was a strong predictor
                 of nonrecurrent AF (15\% with recurrence vs. 68\% without,
                 p = 0.002). Qualitatively, patients without recurrence had
                 more completely circumferentially scarred veins (55\% vs.
                 35\% of veins, p = NS). Patients without recurrence more
                 frequently had scar in the inferior portion of the right
                 inferior pulmonary vein (RIPV) (82\% vs. 31\%, p = 0.025,
                 Bonferroni corrected). The volume of scar in the RIPV was
                 quantitatively greater in patients without AF recurrence
                 (p < or = 0.05) and was a univariate predictor of
                 recurrence using Cox regression (p = 0.049, Bonferroni
                 corrected). CONCLUSIONS: Among patients undergoing PV
                 isolation, AF recurrence during the first year is
                 associated with a lesser degree of PV and left atrial
                 scarring on 3-dimensional LGE CMR. This finding was
                 significant for RIPV scar and may have implications for
                 the procedural technique used in PV isolation.",

                 registration of 4D time-series of images based on the
                 Diffeomorphic Demons (DD) algorithm. In this framework,
                 the 4D spatiotemporal registration is decoupled into a 4D
                 temporal registration, defined as mapping physiological
                 states, and a 4D spatial registration, defined as mapping
                 trajectories of physical points. Our contribution focuses
                 more specifically on the 4D spatial registration that
                 should be consistent over time as opposed to 3D
                 registration that solely aims at mapping homologous points
                 at a given time-point. First, we estimate in each sequence
                 the motion displacement field, which is a dense
                 representation of the point trajectories we want to
                 register. Then, we perform simultaneously 3D registrations
                 of corresponding time-points with the constraints to map
                 the same physical points over time called the trajectory
                 constraints. Under these constraints, we show that the 4D
                 spatial registration can be formulated as a multichannel
                 registration of 3D images. To solve it, we propose a novel
                 version of the Diffeomorphic Demons (DD) algorithm
                 extended to vector-valued 3D images, the Multichannel
                 Diffeomorphic Demons (MDD). For evaluation, this framework
                 is applied to the registration of 4D cardiac computed
                 tomography (CT) sequences and compared to other standard
                 methods with real patient data and synthetic data
                 simulated from a physiologically realistic
                 electromechanical cardiac model. Results show that the
                 trajectory constraints act as a temporal regularization
                 consistent with motion whereas the multichannel
                 registration acts as a spatial regularization. Finally,
                 using these trajectory constraints with multichannel
                 registration yields the best compromise between
                 registration accuracy, temporal and spatial smoothness,
                 and computation times. A prospective example of
                 application is also presented with the spatiotemporal
                 registration of 4D cardiac CT sequences of the same
                 patient before and after radiofrequency ablation (RFA) in
                 case of atrial fibrillation (AF). The intersequence
                 spatial transformations over a cardiac cycle allow to
                 analyze and quantify the regression of left ventricular
                 hypertrophy and its impact on the cardiac function.",

                 underestimate the degree of diffusion anisotropy. New
                 indices calculated from the entire diffusion tensor are
                 rotationally invariant (RI). They show that anisotropy
                 is highly variable in different white matter regions
                 depending on the degree of coherence of fiber tract
                 directions. In structures with a regular, parallel
                 fiber arrangement, water diffusivity in the direction
                 parallel to the fibers (Dparallel approximately
                 1400-1800 x 10(-6) mm2/s) is almost 10 times higher
                 than the average diffusivity in directions
                 perpendicular to them (D + D)/2 [corrected]
                 approximately 150-300 x 10(-6) mm2/s), and is almost
                 three times higher than previously reported. In
                 structures where the fiber pattern is less coherent
                 (e.g., where fiber bundles merge), diffusion anisotropy
                 is significantly reduced. However, RI anisotropy
                 indices are still susceptible to noise contamination.
                 Monte Carlo simulations show that these indices are
                 statistically biased, particularly those requiring
                 sorting of the eigenvalues of the diffusion tensor
                 based on their magnitude. A new intervoxel anisotropy
                 index is proposed that locally averages inner products
                 between diffusion tensors in neighboring voxels. This
                 lattice RI index has an acceptably low error variance
                 and is less susceptible to bias than any other RI
                 anisotropy index proposed to date.",

                 multiscale computer models of the heart are playing an
                 increasingly important role in advancing our understanding
                 of integrated cardiac function in health and disease. Such
                 detailed simulations, however, are computationally vastly
                 demanding, which is a limiting factor for a wider adoption
                 of in-silico modeling. While current trends in high
                 performance computing (HPC) hardware promise to alleviate
                 this problem, exploiting the potential of such
                 architectures remains challenging since strongly scalable
                 algorithms are necessitated to reduce execution times.
                 Alternatively, acceleration technologies such as graphics
                 processing units (GPUs) are being considered. While the
                 potential of GPUs has been demonstrated in various
                 applications, benefits in the context of bidomain
                 simulations where large sparse linear systems have to be
                 solved in parallel with advanced numerical techniques, are
                 less clear. In this study, the feasibility of multi- GPU
                 bidomain simulations is demonstrated by running strong
                 scalability benchmarks using a state-of-the-art model of
                 rabbit ventricles. The model is spatially discretized
                 using the finite element methods (FEM) on fully
                 unstructured grids. The GPU code is directly derived from
                 a large pre-existing code, the Cardiac Arrhythmia Research
                 Package (CARP), with very minor perturbation of the code
                 base. Overall, bidomain simulations were sped up by a
                 factor of 11.8 to 16.3 in benchmarks running on 620 GPUs
                 compared to the same number of CPU cores. To match the
                 fastest GPU simulation which engaged 20 GPUs, 476 CPU
                 cores were required on a national supercomputing facility.",

                 a subcellular to cellular size scale, and verifies the
                 performance of the method through biophysical modeling.
                 Although elements of the plan have been analyzed
                 previously, their performance as a whole is considered
                 here in a comprehensive way. Our analyses take advantage
                 of a three-dimensional structural framework in which
                 interstitial, intracellular, and membrane components are
                 coupled to one another on the fine size scale, and
                 electrodes are separated from one another as in arrays we
                 fabricate routinely. With this arrangement, determination
                 of passive tissue resistances can be made from
                 measurements taken on top of the currents flowing in
                 active tissue. In particular, our results show that
                 measurements taken at multiple frequencies and electrode
                 separations provide powerful predictions of the underlying
                 tissue resistances in all geometric dimensions. Because of
                 the small electrode size, separation of interstitial from
                 intracellular compartment contributions is readily
                 achieved.",

  robnote =      "INTRODUCTION: Large animal models of progressive atrial
                 fibrosis would provide an attractive platform to study
                 relationship between structural and electrical remodeling
                 in atrial fibrillation (AF). Here we established a new
                 transgenic goat model of AF with cardiac specific
                 overexpression of TGF-beta1 and investigated the changes
                 in the cardiac structure and function leading to AF.
                 METHODS AND RESULTS: Transgenic goats with cardiac
                 specific overexpression of constitutively active TGF-beta1
                 were generated by somatic cell nuclear transfer. We
                 examined myocardial tissue, ECGs, echocardiographic data,
                 and AF susceptibility in transgenic and wild-type control
                 goats. Transgenic goats exhibited significant increase in
                 fibrosis and myocyte diameters in the atria compared to
                 controls, but not in the ventricles. P-wave duration was
                 significantly greater in transgenic animals starting at 12
                 months of age, but no significant chamber enlargement was
                 detected, suggesting conduction slowing in the atria.
                 Furthermore, this transgenic goat model exhibited a
                 significant increase in AF vulnerability. Six of 8
                 transgenic goats (75\%) were susceptible to AF induction
                 and exhibited sustained AF (>2 minutes), whereas none of 6
                 controls displayed sustained AF (P < 0.01). Length of
                 induced AF episodes was also significantly greater in the
                 transgenic group compared to controls (687 +/- 212.02
                 seconds vs. 2.50 +/- 0.88 seconds, P < 0.0001), but no
                 persistent or permanent AF was observed. CONCLUSION: A
                 novel transgenic goat model with a substrate for AF was
                 generated. In this model, cardiac overexpression of
                 TGF-beta1 led to an increase in fibrosis and myocyte size
                 in the atria, and to progressive P-wave prolongation. We
                 suggest that these factors underlie increased AF
                 susceptibility.",

                 cylindrical harmonics, and shape-based interpolation were
                 implemented for comparison. In the thorough evaluation of
                 the processing pipeline, Hi-res magnetic resonance (MR),
                 computed tomography (CT), and diffusion tensor (DT) MR
                 images from numerous hearts were used. Qualitative and
                 quantitative comparison of these ventricular geometry
                 reconstructions showed that the variational implicit
                 functions approach performed better than others.

                 local [Ca2+]i transients (such as Ca2+ sparks in
                 cardiac muscle) is complicated by uncertainties in the
                 position of the origin of the Ca2+ spark (relative to
                 the scan line) and by the dynamics of Ca(2+)-dye
                 interactions. An investigation of the effects of these
                 complications modeled the release, diffusion, binding,
                 and uptake of Ca2+ in cardiac cells (producing a
                 theoretical Ca2+ spark) and image formation in a
                 confocal microscope (after measurement of its
                 point-spread function) and simulated line-scan images
                 of a theoretical Ca2+ spark (when it was viewed from
                 all possible positions relative to the scan line). In
                 line-scan images, Ca2+ sparks that arose in a different
                 optical section or with the site of origin displaced
                 laterally from the scan line appeared attenuated,
                 whereas their rise times slowed down only slightly.
                 These results indicate that even if all Ca2+ sparks are
                 perfectly identical events, except for their site of
                 origin, there will be an apparent variation in the
                 amplitude and other characteristics of Ca2+ sparks as
                 measured from confocal line-scan images. The frequency
                 distributions of the kinetic parameters (i.e., peak
                 amplitude, rise time, fall time) of Ca2+ sparks were
                 calculated for repetitive registration of stereotyped
                 Ca2+ sparks in two experimental situations: 1) random
                 position of the scan line relative to possible SR
                 Ca(2+)-release sites and 2) fixed position of the scan
                 line going through a set of possible SR Ca(2+)-release
                 sites. The effects of noise were incorporated into the
                 model, and a visibility function was proposed to
                 account for the subjective factors that may be involved
                 in the evaluation of Ca(2+)-spark image parameters from
                 noisy experimental recordings. The mean value of the
                 resulting amplitude distributions underestimates the
                 brightness of in-focus Ca2+ sparks because large
                 numbers of out-of-focus Ca2+ sparks are detected (as
                 small Ca2+ sparks). The distribution of peak amplitudes
                 may split into more than one subpopulation even when
                 one is viewing stereotyped Ca2+ sparks because of the
                 discrete locations of possible SR Ca(2+)-release sites
                 in mammalian ventricular heart cells. No hard copy.",

                 biophysically based model of the human gastrointestinal
                 (GI) tract is presented. A major objective of this work
                 is to develop a modelling framework that can be used to
                 integrate the physiological, anatomical and medical
                 knowledge of the GI system. The anatomical model was
                 developed by fitting derivative continuous meshes to
                 digitised data taken from images of the visible man.
                 Structural information, including fibre distributions
                 of the smooth muscle layers and the arrangement of the
                 networks of interstitial cells of Cajal, were
                 incorporated using published information. A continuum
                 modelling framework was used to simulate electrical
                 activity from the single cell to the whole organ and
                 body. Also computed was the external magnetic field
                 generated from the GI electrical activity. The set of
                 governing equations were solved using a combination of
                 numerical techniques. Activity at the (continuum) cell
                 level was solved using a high-resolution trilinear
                 finite element procedure that had been defined from the
                 previously fitted C1 continuous anatomical mesh.
                 Multiple dipolar sources were created from the
                 excitation waves which were embedded within a coupled
                 C1 continuous torso model to produce both the cutaneous
                 electrical field and the external magnetic field.
                 Initial simulations were performed using a simplified
                 geometry to test the implementation of the numerical
                 solution procedure. The numerical procedures were shown
                 to rapidly converge with mesh refinement. In the
                 process of this testing, errors in a long standing
                 analytic solution were identified and are corrected in
                 Appendix B. Results of single cell activity were
                 compared to published results illustrating that the key
                 features of the slow wave activity were successfully
                 replicated. Simulations using a two-dimensional slice
                 through the gastric wall produced slow wave activity
                 that agreed with the known frequency and propagation
                 characteristics. Three-dimensional simulations were
                 also performed using the full stomach mesh and results
                 illustrated the slow wave propagation throughout the
                 stomach musculature.",

                 these changes would manifest as rate-related effects on
                 electrical propagation in the intact heart. This study
                 employed optical mapping to characterize propagation
                 changes in intact mouse hearts with
                 cardiomyocyte-restricted knock out of insulin receptors
                 (CIRKO). None of the 8 CIRKO hearts maintained regular
                 responses to atrial stimulation at the 160 ms cycle
                 length under normal conditions; however, all of the WT
                 hearts were captured at this rate. Total activation
                 time for a 4 mm by 4 mm area was longer for CIRKO
                 hearts when compared with WT. Average epicardial
                 conduction velocity was slower for the CIRKO when
                 compared to WT. Propagation delay due to the presence
                 of high [K+]e was significant in both CIRKO and WT
                 mice, but significantly longer for the CIRKO hearts.
                 CONCLUSIONS: These results show that in addition to
                 reducing repolarization currents, impaired myocardial
                 insulin signaling leads to impaired electrical impulse
                 propagation particularly at increased heart rates.
                 These data suggest a link between impaired myocardial
                 insulin signaling and the increased risk of arrhythmia
                 and sudden death in patients with diabetes.",

                 model of an adult male subject. A finite element model
                 of the torso was built with 19 major tissue types
                 identified. The myocardial fibre orientation in the
                 heart wall was included with a voxel resolution of
                 0.078 x 0.078 x 0.3 cm. The fibre orientations from the
                 canine heart which are available in the literature were
                 mapped to our adult male subject's human heart using
                 deformable mapping techniques. The current and
                 potential distribution in the whole torso were computed
                 using an idealized dipolar source of +/-1.0 V in the
                 middle of the septum of the heart wall as a boundary
                 condition. An adaptive finite element solver was used.
                 Two cases were studied. In one case the myocardium was
                 isotropic and in the other it was anisotropic. It was
                 found that the current density distribution shows a
                 very noticeable difference between the isotropic and
                 anisotropic myocardium. The resultant magnetic field in
                 front of the torso was computed using the Biot-Savart
                 law. It was found that the magnetic field profile was
                 slightly affected by the myocardial anisotropy. The

                 changes due to the myocardial anisotropy.",

                 resonance imaging (RT-MRI) system, leading to a complete
                 and transmural ablation in the atrium. METHODS AND
                 RESULTS: A swine model was used for these studies (n=12).
                 Ablation lesions with a gap were created in the atrium
                 using fluoroscopy and an electroanatomic system in the
                 first group (n=5). The animal was then moved to a 3-tesla
                 MRI system where high-resolution late gadolinium
                 enhancement MRI was used to identify the gap. Using an
                 RT-MRI catheter navigation and visualization system, the
                 gap area was ablated in the MR scanner. In a second group
                 (n=7), ablation lesions with varying gaps in between were
                 created under RT-MRI guidance, and gap lengths determined
                 using late gadolinium enhancement MR images were
                 correlated with gap length measured from gross pathology.
                 Gaps up to 1.0 mm were identified using gross pathology,
                 and gaps up to 1.4 mm were identified using late
                 gadolinium enhancement MRI. Using an RT-MRI system with
                 active catheter navigation gaps can be targeted acutely,
                 leading to lesion sets with no gaps. The correlation
                 coefficient (R(2)) between the gap length was identified
                 using MRI, and the gross pathology was 0.95. CONCLUSIONS:
                 RT-MRI system can be used to identify and acutely target
                 gaps in atrial ablation lesion sets. Acute targeting of
                 gaps in ablation lesion sets can potentially lead to
                 significant improvement in clinical outcomes.",

                 patients. This study aimed to: (1) develop a new image
                 processing pipeline for constructing patient-specific
                 heart-torso models from clinical magnetic resonance images
                 (MRIs); (2) use the pipeline to determine the optimal ICD
                 configuration in a paediatric tricuspid valve atresia
                 patient; (3) establish whether the widely used criterion
                 of shock-induced extracellular potential (Phie) gradients
                 >/=5 V cm(-1) in >/=95\% of ventricular volume predicts
                 defibrillation success. A biophysically detailed
                 heart-torso model was generated from patient MRIs. Because
                 transvenous access was impossible, three subcutaneous and
                 three epicardial lead placement sites were identified
                 along with five ICD scan locations. Ventricular
                 fibrillation was induced, and defibrillation shocks were
                 applied from 11 ICD configurations to determine
                 defibrillation thresholds (DFTs). Two configurations with
                 epicardial leads resulted in the lowest DFTs overall and
                 were thus considered optimal. Three configurations shared
                 the lowest DFT among subcutaneous lead ICDs. The Phie
                 gradient criterion was an inadequate predictor of
                 defibrillation success, as defibrillation failed in
                 numerous instances even when 100\% of the myocardium
                 experienced such gradients. In conclusion, we have
                 developed a new image processing pipeline and applied it
                 to a CHD patient to construct the first active heart-torso

                 modelling, there is still a strong need to make
                 macroscopic models usable in planning and assistance of
                 the clinical procedures. This requires model
                 personalisation i.e. estimation of patient-specific model
                 parameters and computations compatible with clinical
                 constraints. Fast macroscopic models allow a quick
                 estimation of the tissue conductivity, but are often
                 unreliable in prediction of arrhythmias. On the other
                 side, complex biophysical models are quite expensive for
                 the tissue conductivity estimation, but are well suited
                 for arrhythmia predictions. Here we present a coupled
                 personalisation framework, which combines the benefits of
                 the two models. A fast Eikonal (EK) model is used to
                 estimate the conductivity parameters, which are then used
                 to set the parameters of a biophysical model, the
                 Mitchell-Schaeffer (MS) model. Additional parameters
                 related to Action Potential Duration (APD) and APD
                 restitution curves for the tissue are estimated for the MS
                 model. This framework is applied to a clinical dataset
                 provided with an hybrid X-Ray/MR imaging on an ischemic
                 patient. This personalised MS Model is then used for in
                 silico simulation of clinical Ventricular Tachycardia (VT)
                 stimulation protocol to predict the induction of VT. This
                 proof of concept opens up possibilities of using VT
                 induction modelling directly in the intervention room, in
                 order to plan the radio-frequency ablation lines. INRIA",

                 a very efficient tool to better understand the mechanisms
                 of arrhythmias. Quantitative adjustment of such models to
                 experimental data (personalization) is needed in order to
                 test their realism and predictive power, but it remains
                 challenging at the organ scale. In this paper, we propose
                 a framework for the personalization of a 3-D cardiac EP
                 model, the Mitchell-Schaeffer (MS) model, and evaluate its
                 volumetric predictive power under various pacing
                 scenarios. The personalization was performed on ex vivo
                 large porcine healthy hearts using diffusion tensor MRI
                 (DT-MRI) and optical mapping data. The MS model was
                 simulated on a 3-D mesh incorporating local fiber
                 orientations, built from DT-MRI. The 3-D model parameters
                 were optimized using features such as 2-D epicardial
                 depolarization and repolarization maps, extracted from the
                 optical mapping. We also evaluated the sensitivity of our
                 personalization framework to different pacing locations
                 and showed results on its robustness. Further, we
                 evaluated volumetric model predictions for various epi-
                 and endocardial pacing scenarios. We demonstrated
                 promising results with a mean personalization error around
                 5 ms and a mean prediction error around 10 ms (5\% of the
                 total depolarization time). Finally, we discussed the

                 change in refractoriness in both normal and ischemic
                 myocardia, there was no difference in the dimension of
                 the potential reentrant pathway, that is, the
                 continuous line of functional conduction block, around
                 which the reentrant wave fronts circulate. Yet,
                 flecainide resulted in significant rate-dependent
                 slowing of conduction preferentially in ischemic
                 myocardium. The additional slowing of conduction of the
                 common reentrant wave front coupled with minimal
                 changes in the length of the reentrant pathway allowed
                 additional time for the wave front to reexcite normal
                 myocardium on the proximal side of the arc of block.
                 After flecainide, reentry could be induced in hearts in
                 which reentry could not be induced during control. The
                 same proarrhythmic mechanism explains the propensity of
                 nonsustained figure-8 reentrant tachycardias to become
                 sustained after flecainide. LQTS, SCOR",

                 behavior of a fully active bundle is considered in a
                 companion paper. The bundle is formed by concentric
                 layers of small cylindrical fibers (radius 5 microns),
                 with a uniform minimum distance (d) between any two
                 adjacent fibers, to yield a bundle radius of about 72
                 microns. Individual fibers are identical continuous
                 cables of excitable membrane based on a modified
                 Beeler-Reuter model. The intracellular volume fraction
                 (fi) increases to a maximum of about 90\% as d is
                 reduced and remains unchanged for d < 0.01 micron. In
                 the range of d < 0.01 micron, the central fiber is
                 effectively shielded from external effects by the first
                 concentric layer of inactive fibers, and a large
                 capacitive load current flows across the surrounding
                 inactive membranes. In addition, the fiber proximity
                 produces a circumferentially nonuniform current density
                 (proximity effect) that is equivalent to an increased
                 average longitudinal interstitial resistance. The
                 conduction velocity is reduced as d becomes smaller in
                 the range of d < 0.1 micron, the interstitial potential
                 becomes larger, and both the maximum rate of rise and
                 time constant of the foot of the upstroke are
                 increased. On the other hand, for d > 0.1 micron, there
                 are negligible changes in the shape of the upstroke,
                 and the behavior of the central fiber is close to that
                 of a uniform cable in a restricted volume conductor.
                 For d larger than about 1.2 microns, the active fiber
                 environment is close to an unbounded isotropic volume

                 Therefore, improvements in the discrete formulation of the
                 problem, which decrease computational and/or memory
                 demands are highly desirable. In this study, we propose a
                 novel technique for computing shape functions of finite
                 elements (FEs). The technique generates macro FEs (MFEs)
                 based on the local decomposition of elements into
                 tetrahedral subelements with linear shape functions. Such
                 an approach necessitates the direct use of hybrid meshes
                 (HMs) composed of different types of elements. MFEs are
                 compared to classic standard FEs with respect to accuracy
                 and RAM memory usage under different scenarios of cardiac
                 modeling, including bidomain and monodomain simulations in
                 2-D and 3-D for simple and complex tissue geometries. In
                 problems with analytical solutions, MFEs displayed the
                 same numerical accuracy of standard linear triangular and
                 tetrahedral elements. In propagation simulations,
                 conduction velocity and activation times agreed very well
                 with those computed with standard FEs. However, MFEs offer
                 a significant decrease in memory requirements. We conclude
                 that HMs composed of MFEs are well suited for solving
                 problems in cardiac computational electrophysiology.",

                 right ventricles in vulnerability to electric shocks in
                 rabbit hearts. The ventricles were paced apically, and
                 uniform-field, truncated-exponential, monophasic shocks
                 of reversed polarity were applied over a range of
                 coupling intervals (CIs) in experiment and model.
                 Experiments and simulations revealed that reversing the
                 direction of externally-applied field (RV- or LV-
                 shocks) alters the shape of the vulnerability area
                 (VA), the 2-D grid encompassing episodes of arrhythmia
                 induction. For RV- shocks, VA was nearly rectangular
                 indicating little dependence of postshock
                 arrhythmogenesis on CI. For LV- shocks, the probability
                 of arrhythmia induction was higher for longer than for
                 shorter CIs. The 3-D simulations demonstrated that
                 these effects stem from the fact that reversal of field
                 direction results in relocation of the main postshock
                 excitable area from LV wall (RV- shocks) to septum (LV-
                 shocks). Furthermore, the effect of septal (but not LV)
                 excitable area in postshock propagation was found to
                 strongly depend on preshock state. Knowledge regarding
                 the location of the main postshock excitable area
                 within the 3-D ventricular volume could be important
                 for improving defibrillation efficacy.",

                 the effects of the geometric complexity, nonuniform
                 muscle fiber orientation, and material inhomogeneity of
                 the ventricular wall on cardiac impulse propagation.
                 The method was used to solve a modification to the
                 FitzHugh-Nagumo system of equations. The geometry,
                 local muscle fiber orientation, and material parameters
                 of the domain were defined using linear Lagrange or
                 cubic Hermite finite element interpolation. Spatial
                 variations of time-dependent excitation and recovery
                 variables were approximated using cubic Hermite finite
                 element interpolation, and the governing finite element
                 equations were assembled using the collocation method.
                 To overcome the deficiencies of conventional
                 collocation methods on irregular domains, Galerkin
                 equations for the no-flux boundary conditions were used
                 instead of collocation equations for the boundary
                 degrees-of-freedom. The resulting system was evolved
                 using an adaptive Runge-Kutta method. Converged
                 two-dimensional simulations of normal propagation
                 showed that this method requires less CPU time than a
                 traditional finite difference discretization. The model
                 also reproduced several other physiologic phenomena
                 known to be important in arrhythmogenesis including:
                 Wenckebach periodicity, slowed propagation and
                 unidirectional block due to wavefront curvature,
                 reentry around a fixed obstacle, and spiral wave
                 reentry. In a new result, we observed wavespeed
                 variations and block due to nonuniform muscle fiber
                 orientation. The findings suggest that the finite
                 element method is suitable for studying normal and
                 pathological cardiac activation and has significant
                 advantages over existing techniques.",

                 procedures. To maximize the efficacy of image
                 integration, it is essential to obtain good alignment
                 between the electroanatomical map and the 3D image of
                 the heart. In the present study, we compared an
                 ICE-guided landmark registration with an ICE-guided
                 focused endocardial surface registration. METHODS AND
                 RESULTS: In 20 patients, registration was based on
                 posterior landmarks acquired under ICE guidance (group
                 A); in another 20 matched patients, a new ICE-guided
                 focused endocardial surface registration technique was
                 used (group B). In these latter patients, a single
                 landmark was acquired in the inferior part of the LIPV,
                 and several surface points were recorded in the
                 posterior area of the left PV antrum and around the
                 antra of the right PVs. The mean ablation point-to-CT
                 image distance was calculated in both groups. In group
                 A, the mean landmark point-to-CT image distance was
                 also calculated after adding the surface registration.
                 The mean landmark point-to-CT image distance was 4.62
                 +/- 1.65 mm and increased to 7.66 +/- 2.44 mm when
                 surface registration was added. The ablation
                 point-to-CT image distance was significantly shorter in
                 group B (1.73 +/- 0.29 mm vs 3 +/- 0.99 mm; P < 0.001).
                 CONCLUSIONS: This ICE-guided focused endocardial
                 surface registration seems to be superior to landmark
                 registration in achieving a better alignment between
                 the CT/MR image and the electroanatomical map. The
                 concurrent use of standard surface registration may
                 result in rotation of the atrial chamber.",

                 these patients. Therefore, there is a major need to
                 develop noninvasive diagnostic technologies to identify
                 patients at risk. Recent studies have demonstrated that

                 convened a workshop of cardiologists, cardiac
                 electrophysiologists, cell biophysicists, and
                 computational modelers on August 20 and 21, 2007, in
                 Washington, DC, to advise the NHLBI on new research
                 directions needed to develop integrative approaches to
                 elucidate human cardiac function. The workshop strove to
                 identify limitations in the use of data from nonhuman
                 animal species for elucidation of human electromechanical
                 function/activity and to identify what specific
                 information on ion channel kinetics, calcium handling, and
                 dynamic changes in the intracellular/extracellular milieu
                 is needed from human cardiac tissues to develop more
                 robust computational models of human cardiac
                 electromechanical activity. This article summarizes the
                 workshop discussions and recommendations on the following
                 topics: (1) limitations of animal models and differences
                 from human electrophysiology, (2) modeling ion channel
                 structure/function in the context of whole-cell
                 electrophysiology, (3) excitation-contraction coupling and
                 regulatory pathways, (4) whole-heart simulations of human
                 electromechanical activity, and (5) what human data are
                 currently needed and how to obtain them. The

                 with intracardiac echocardiography (ICE) immediately
                 before and after PV isolation may be a useful method
                 for predicting which patients will develop chronic PV
                 stenosis. METHODS AND RESULTS: We assessed preablation
                 and postablation flows in each of the four PVs using a
                 phase-array ICE catheter in 95 patients (mean age 52
                 +/- 13) undergoing atrial fibrillation ablation. The
                 ostium of each of the PVs was defined using
                 angiography, electrical mapping, and ICE imaging.
                 Ostial electrical isolation of all PVs was achieved
                 using a 4-mm cooled-tip radiofrequency ablation
                 catheter. Change in PV flow, when present, was examined
                 as both an absolute value and as a percentage of the
                 baseline flow. All patients underwent spiral computed
                 tomography (CT) scans of the PVs 3 months after the
                 procedure for detection of stenosis. The average
                 preablation diastolic flows for the left superior, left
                 inferior, right superior, and right inferior veins were
                 0.56, 0.54, 0.47, and 0.45 m/sec, respectively. These
                 values increased to 0.74, 0.67, 0.58, and 0.59 m/sec
                 postablation (P < 0.001). Of 380 PVs ablated, the CT
                 scans revealed 2 (1\%) with severe (>70\%) stenosis, 13
                 (3\%) with moderate (51\%-70\%) stenosis, and 62 (16\%)
                 with mild (< or = 50\%) stenosis. The r value between
                 flow and stenosis was only 0.09 (P = NS). CONCLUSION:
                 Acute changes in PV flow immediately after ostial PV
                 isolation do not appear to be a strong predictor of
                 chronic PV stenosis.",

                 the 30 VTs, 24 (6 with ischemic cardiomyopathy, 3 with
                 idiopathic cardiomyopathy, and 15 with normal hearts)
                 appeared to originate from the epicardium. Seventeen
                 (71\%) of these 24 VTs were successfully ablated with
                 epicardial lesions. The other 7 VTs had early
                 epicardial sites that were inaccessible, predominantly
                 because of interference from the left atrial appendage.
                 Six of these were successfully ablated from the left
                 coronary cusp. In 5 of the 10 patients with an AP, the
                 earliest activation was recorded epicardially. Three of
                 these were right atrial appendage-to-right ventricle
                 APs, and epicardial ablation was successful. No
                 significant complications were observed. CONCLUSIONS:
                 Failure of endocardial ablation could reflect the
                 presence of an epicardial arrhythmia substrate.
                 Epicardial instrumentation and ablation appeared
                 feasible and safe and provided an alternative strategy
                 for the treatment of patients with a variety of
                 arrhythmias. This was particularly true for VT,
                 including patients without structural heart disease.",

  abstract =     "BACKGROUND: The extent of the peri-infarct zone by
                 magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has been related to
                 all-cause mortality in patients with coronary artery
                 disease. This relationship may result from
                 arrhythmogenesis in the infarct border. However, the
                 relationship between tissue heterogeneity in the
                 infarct periphery and arrhythmic substrate has not been
                 investigated. In the present study, we quantify
                 myocardial infarct heterogeneity by contrast-enhanced
                 MRI and relate it to an electrophysiological marker of
                 arrhythmic substrate in patients with left ventricular
                 (LV) systolic dysfunction undergoing prophylactic
                 implantable cardioverter defibrillator placement. Tissue
                 heterogeneity is present and quantifiable within human
                 infarcts. More extensive tissue heterogeneity
                 correlates with increased ventricular irritability by
                 programmed electrical stimulation. These findings
                 support the hypothesis that anatomic tissue
                 heterogeneity increases susceptibility to ventricular
                 arrhythmias in patients with prior myocardial
                 infarction and LV dysfunction.",

                 failure of drug candidates in clinical development, where
                 the great majority of these drugs fail due to lack of
                 efficacy, speak directly to the need for more innovative
                 approaches to study the mechanisms of disease and drug
                 discovery. Here we review systems biology approaches that
                 have been devised over the last several years to
                 understand the biology of disease at a more holistic
                 level. By integrating a diversity of data like DNA
                 variation, gene expression, protein-protein interaction,
                 DNA-protein binding, and other types of molecular
                 phenotype data, more comprehensive networks of genes both
                 within and between tissues can be constructed to paint a
                 more complete picture of the molecular processes
                 underlying physiological states associated with disease.
                 These more integrative, systems-level methods lead to
                 networks that are demonstrably predictive, which in turn
                 provides a deeper context within which single genes
                 operate such as those identified from genome-wide
                 association studies or those targeted for therapeutic
                 intervention. The more comprehensive views of disease that
                 result from these methods have the potential to
                 dramatically enhance the way in which novel drug targets
                 are identified and developed, ultimately increasing the
                 probability of success for taking new drugs through
                 clinical development. We highlight a number of the
                 integrative approaches via examples that have resulted not
                 only in the identification of novel genes for diabetes and
                 cardiovascular disease, but in more comprehensive networks
                 as well that describe the context in which the disease
                 genes operate.",

                 arrhythmia in the general population. As an age-related
                 arrhythmia AF is becoming a huge socio-economic burden for
                 European healthcare systems. Despite significant progress
                 in our understanding of the pathophysiology of AF,
                 therapeutic strategies for AF have not changed
                 substantially and the major challenges in the management
                 of AF are still unmet. This lack of progress may be
                 related to the multifactorial pathogenesis of atrial
                 remodelling and AF that hampers the identification of
                 causative pathophysiological alterations in individual
                 patients. Also, again new mechanisms have been identified
                 and the relative contribution of these mechanisms still
                 has to be established. In November 2010, the European
                 Union launched the large collaborative project EUTRAF
                 (European Network of Translational Research in Atrial
                 Fibrillation) to address these challenges. The main aims
                 of EUTRAF are to study the main mechanisms of initiation
                 and perpetuation of AF, to identify the molecular
                 alterations underlying atrial remodelling, to develop
                 markers allowing to monitor this processes, and suggest
                 strategies to treat AF based on insights in newly defined
                 disease mechanisms. This article reports on the

                 element meshes are well suited for modeling the
                 homogeneous or mildly heterogeneous domains presented
                 by man-made objects, but are difficult to apply to the
                 complex 3-D domains encountered in some biomedical
                 applications. In this paper, we describe an adaptive
                 algorithm that automates the modeling of these domains.
                 The method differs from traditional approaches in that
                 no explicit description is required of the boundaries
                 between objects with dissimilar material properties.
                 The algorithm uses images of the tissue class to build
                 irregular meshes, and continuity is enforced by
                 constraining the solution at irregular nodes. Local
                 estimates of the error in the flux solution are used to
                 refine the mesh. For an analytic problem with a rapid
                 change along a spherical boundary, the adaptive method
                 converges to a 1\% voltage error using 25\% of the
                 degrees of freedom required by a uniform refinement,
                 and to a 5\% voltage gradient error using 11\% of the
                 degrees of freedom. For a defibrillation model in a pig
                 thorax, the voltage gradient solution in the ventricles
                 of the heart converges to within 5\% of a uniform mesh
                 solution using less than 8\% of the memory and
                 processing resources required by a uniform mesh, which
                 has been the only practical alternative for
                 subject-specific modeling.",

                 myocardium by an electric shock have been shown to
                 correlate to the probability of the shock producing a
                 successful defibrillation. Finite element modeling is
                 one method for computing these voltage gradients,
                 although the meshing of complex biomedical domains is
                 difficult on a patient-specific basis. We recently
                 described an adaptive algorithm that automates the
                 generation of finite element meshes for complex 3-D
                 domains from bitmapped images. This article examines
                 the sensitivity of the computed distribution of
                 ventricular voltage gradients to the resolution of the
                 images and to the adapted density of the mesh. The
                 results allow us to establish an adaptation stopping
                 criterion and a minimum input image resolution for
                 modeling transvenous defibrillation. The sensitivity to
                 adapted mesh density was analyzed by comparing voltage
                 gradient histograms from successively finer meshes to
                 histograms from a uniform mesh at the maximum possible
                 density. Comparisons were made using the
                 Kolmogorov-Smirnov test with the number of samples
                 required to detect a 5\% difference in the histograms
                 at the 0.05 significance level. Adaptation to a global
                 current density error estimate of 5\% or less was
                 required in order to achieve acceptance of the null
                 hypothesis that the distributions were the same in all
                 cases. Defibrillation efficacy, however, is predicted
                 from the voltage gradient in the first quartile, and
                 the results suggest that this region of the cumulative
                 histogram converges faster during mesh adaptation than
                 the histogram as a whole. We also compared histograms
                 from models generated from successively finer input
                 images. The histogram of each model was compared with
                 the histogram obtained from the finest possible
                 resolution. In all cases, the null hypothesis of no
                 difference was accepted at resolutions of 2.3 x 2.3 x
                 3.0 mm. The average time required to build and adapt
                 models to a 5\% accuracy at the first quartile at this
                 resolution was 1.8 min. on a common workstation. We
                 believe that this demonstrates a potential for the
                 eventual synthesis of finite element computations into
                 interactive electrode placement tools on a
                 subject-specific basis.",

                 However, quantitative validation of this MRI method has

                 been widely adopted for treatment of atrial fibrillation
                 (AF), recurrence rates remain unacceptably high with
                 persistent and longstanding AF. As evidence emerges for
                 non-PV substrate changes in the pathogenesis of AF, more
                 extensive ablation strategies need further study. METHODS:
                 We modified our PV antrum isolation procedure to include
                 abatement of posterior and septal wall potentials. We also
                 employed recently described image-processing techniques
                 using delayed-enhancement (DE) MRI to characterize tissue
                 injury patterns 3 months after ablation, to assess whether
                 each PV was encircled with scar, and to assess the impact
                 of these parameters on procedural success. RESULTS: 118
                 consecutive patients underwent debulking procedure and
                 completed follow-up, of which 86 underwent DE-MRI. The
                 total left atrial (LA) radiofrequency delivery correlated
                 with percent LA scarring by DE-MRI (r = 0.6, P < 0.001).
                 Based on DE patterns, complete encirclement was seen in
                 only 131 of 335 PVs (39.1\%). As expected, Cox regression
                 analysis showed a significant relationship between the
                 number of veins encircled by delayed enhancement and
                 clinical success (hazard ratio of 0.62, P = 0.015). Also,
                 progressive quartile increases in postablation posterior
                 and septal wall scarring reduced recurrences rates with a
                 HR of 0.65, P = 0.022 and 0.66, P = 0.026, respectively.
                 CONCLUSION: Pathologic remodeling in the septal and
                 posterior walls of the LA helps form the pathogenic
                 substrate for AF, and these early results suggest that
                 more aggressive treatment of these regions appears to
                 correlate with improved ablation outcomes. Noninvasive
                 imaging to characterize tissue changes after ablation may
                 prove essential to stratifying recurrence risk.",

                 treatment for patients with congestive heart failure and a
                 wide QRS complex. However, up to 30\% of patients are
                 non-responders to therapy in terms of exercise capacity or
                 left ventricular reverse remodelling. A number of
                 controversies still remain surrounding patient selection,
                 targeted lead implantation and optimisation of this
                 important treatment. The development of biophysical models
                 to predict the response to CRT represents a potential
                 strategy to address these issues. In this article, we
                 present how the personalisation of an electromechanical
                 model of the myocardium can predict the acute haemodynamic
                 changes associated with CRT. In order to introduce such an
                 approach as a clinical application, we needed to design
                 models that can be individualised from images and
                 electrophysiological mapping of the left ventricle. In
                 this paper the personalisation of the anatomy, the
                 electrophysiology, the kinematics and the mechanics are
                 described. The acute effects of pacing on pressure
                 development were predicted with the in silico model for
                 several pacing conditions on two patients, achieving good
                 agreement with invasive haemodynamic measurements: the
                 mean error on dP/dt(max) is 47.5+/-35mmHgs(-1), less than
                 5\% error. These promising results demonstrate the
                 potential of physiological models personalised from images
                 and electrophysiology signals to improve patient selection

                 of a novel 3-dimensional, noninvasive, beat-by-beat
                 mapping system, Electrocardiographic Mapping (ECM), in
                 facilitating the diagnosis of atrial tachycardias (AT).
                 BACKGROUND: Conventional 12-lead electrocardiogram, a
                 widely used noninvasive tool in clinical arrhythmia
                 practice, has diagnostic limitations. METHODS: Various AT
                 (de novo and post-atrial fibrillation ablation) were
                 mapped using ECM followed by standard-of-care
                 electrophysiological mapping and ablation in 52 patients.
                 The ECM consisted of recording body surface electrograms
                 from a 252-electrode-vest placed on the torso combined
                 with computed tomography-scan-based biatrial anatomy
                 (CardioInsight Inc., Cleveland, Ohio). We evaluated the
                 feasibility of this system in defining the mechanism of
                 AT-macro-re-entrant (perimitral, cavotricuspid
                 isthmus-dependent, and roof-dependent circuits) versus
                 centrifugal (focal-source) activation-and the location of
                 arrhythmia in centrifugal AT. The accuracy of the
                 noninvasive diagnosis and detection of ablation targets
                 was evaluated vis-a-vis subsequent invasive mapping and
                 successful ablation. RESULTS: Comparison between ECM and
                 electrophysiological diagnosis could be accomplished in 48
                 patients (48 AT) but was not possible in 4 patients where
                 the AT mechanism changed to another AT (n = 1), atrial
                 fibrillation (n = 1), or sinus rhythm (n = 2) during the
                 electrophysiological procedure. ECM correctly diagnosed AT
                 mechanisms in 44 of 48 (92\%) AT: macro-re-entry in 23 of
                 27; and focal-onset with centrifugal activation in 21 of
                 21. The region of interest for focal AT perfectly matched
                 in 21 of 21 (100\%) AT. The 2:1 ventricular conduction and
                 low-amplitude P waves challenged the diagnosis of 4 of 27
                 macro-re-entrant (perimitral) AT that can be overcome by
                 injecting atrioventricular node blockers and signal
                 averaging, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: This prospective
                 multicenter series shows a high success rate of ECM in
                 accurately diagnosing the mechanism of AT and the location
                 of focal arrhythmia. Intraprocedural use of the system and
                 its application to atrial fibrillation mapping is under
                 way.",

                 eliminating AF. The incidence of late stroke was also very
                 low. However, this procedure was not widely adopted owing

                 weeks of ventricular tachypacing (VTP; 220 to 240 bpm)
                 to induce congestive heart failure (CHF), followed by a
                 5-week recovery period leading to hemodynamic
                 normalization at 5-week recovery (Wk5(rec)). The
                 duration of burst pacing-induced AF under
                 ketamine/diazepam/isoflurane anesthesia increased
                 progressively during VTP and recovered toward baseline
                 during the recovery period, paralleling changes in
                 atrial dimensions. However, even at full recovery,
                 sustained AF could still be induced under relatively
                 vagotonic morphine/chloralose anesthesia. Wk5(rec) dogs
                 showed no recovery of CHF-induced atrial fibrosis
                 (3.1+/-0.3\% for controls versus 10.7+/-1.0\% for CHF
                 and 12.0+/-0.8\% for Wk5(rec) dogs) or local conduction
                 abnormalities (conduction heterogeneity index 1.8+/-0.1
                 in controls versus 2.3+/-0.1 in CHF and 2.2+/-0.2 in
                 Wk5(rec) dogs). One week of atrial tachypacing failed
                 to affect the right atrial effective refractory period
                 significantly in CHF dogs but caused highly significant
                 effective refractory period reductions and atrial
                 vulnerability increases in Wk5(rec) dogs. CONCLUSIONS:
                 Reversal of CHF is followed by normalized atrial
                 function and decreased duration of AF; however,
                 fibrosis and conduction abnormalities are not
                 reversible, and a substrate that can support prolonged
                 AF remains. Early intervention to prevent fixed
                 structural abnormalities may be important in patients
                 with conditions that predispose to the arrhythmia.",

                 the increasing role of MRI in diagnosis of musculoskeletal
                 conditions, clinicians have been eager to explore the
                 possibility of using MR guidance for musculoskeletal
                 procedures. Researchers are actively investigating the
                 utility and practicality of MRI compared with more
                 established modalities for procedure guidance such as
                 computed tomography, fluoroscopy, and ultrasound. Early
                 studies have demonstrated the safety and feasibility of MR
                 guidance for biopsies, spine procedures, cyst aspirations,
                 therapeutic injections, and tumor ablation. Applications
                 in the musculoskeletal system are likely to expand as
                 technology improves and clinicians gain more experience.
                 Hybrid X-ray fluoroscopy/MR imaging systems hold great

                 ischemic myocardium. This concept in modeling ischemic
                 injury was derived from the application of principles
                 of electric field theory which had been successfully
                 applied previously to ventricular activation in which
                 QRS potentials are considered to arise from polarized
                 surfaces representing the relatively narrow interfaces
                 between depolarized and nondepolarized myocardium. The
                 present paper outlines the limitations of modeling
                 ischemic injury as a polarized surface in terms of the
                 failure of the predictions of such a model to be
                 supported by the experimentally observed: 1)
                 distribution and relative amplitude of epicardial ST
                 segment elevation overlying a region of ischemia; 2)
                 directional changes in epicardial ST segment elevation
                 that occur with changes in the size of an ischemic
                 region; and 3) nonuniform distribution of transmembrane
                 potential changes which occur within a region of
                 ischemia. A new electrocardiographic model of ischemic
                 injury is formulated which accounts for the nonuniform
                 distribution of transmembrane potential changes which
                 occur throughout a region of ischemia. The model
                 accurately describes experimental observations

                 reticulum (SR) channels (ryanodine receptors or RyRs)
                 opens to release calcium in a locally regenerative
                 manner. Normally triggered by Ca(2+) influx across the
                 sarcolemmal or transverse tubule membrane neighboring
                 the cluster, the Ca(2+) spark has been shown to be the
                 elementary Ca(2+) signaling event of
                 excitation-contraction coupling in heart muscle.
                 However, the question of how the Ca(2+) spark
                 terminates remains a central, unresolved issue. Here we
                 present a new model, sticky cluster, of SR Ca(2+)
                 release that simulates Ca(2+) spark behavior and
                 enables robust Ca(2+) spark termination. Two newly
                 documented features of RyR behavior have been
                 incorporated in this otherwise simple model: coupled
                 gating and an opening rate that depends on SR lumenal
                 [Ca(2+)]. Using a Monte Carlo method, local
                 Ca(2+)-induced Ca(2+) release from clusters containing
                 between 10 and 100 RyRs is modeled. After release is
                 triggered, Ca(2+) flux from RyRs diffuses into the
                 cytosol and binds to intracellular buffers and the
                 fluorescent Ca(2+) indicator fluo-3 to produce the
                 model Ca(2+) spark. Ca(2+) sparks generated by the
                 sticky cluster model resemble those observed
                 experimentally, and Ca(2+) spark duration and amplitude
                 are largely insensitive to the number of RyRs in a
                 cluster. As expected from heart cell investigation, the
                 spontaneous Ca(2+) spark rate in the model increases
                 with elevated cytosolic or SR lumenal [Ca(2+)].
                 Furthermore, reduction of RyR coupling leads to
                 prolonged model Ca(2+) sparks just as treatment with
                 FK506 lengthens Ca(2+) sparks in heart cells. This new
                 model of Ca(2+) spark behavior provides a proof of
                 principle test of a new hypothesis for Ca(2+) spark
                 termination and reproduces critical features of Ca(2+)
                 sparks observed experimentally. No hard copy",

                 approaches, we have tested two different approaches to
                 calculating the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) Ca2+
                 release flux, which gives rise to cardiac muscle Ca2+
                 sparks. By using two-photon excited spot photolysis of
                 DM-Nitrophen, known Ca2+ release flux time courses were
                 generated to provide the first experimental validation
                 of spark flux reconstruction algorithms. These
                 artificial Ca2+ sparks show that it is possible to
                 calculate the SR Ca2+ release waveform with reasonable
                 accuracy, provided the flux equations reasonably
                 reflect the properties of the experimental system.
                 Within cardiac muscle cells, we show that Ca2+ flux
                 reconstruction is complicated by the substantial dye
                 binding to proteins, a factor that has not been
                 adequately addressed in previous flux reconstruction
                 algorithms. Furthermore, our numerical experiments
                 suggest that the calculated time course of release flux
                 inactivation based on conventional flux reconstruction
                 algorithms is likely to be in error. We therefore
                 developed novel algorithms based on an explicit dye
                 binding scheme. When these algorithm were applied to
                 evoked Ca2+ sparks in rat cardiac ventricular myocytes,
                 the reconstructed Ca2+ release waveform peaked in ~5 ms
                 and decayed with a halftime of approximately 5 ms. The
                 peak flux magnitude was 7-12 pA, suggesting that sparks
                 must arise from clusters of >15 ryanodine receptors. No

                 tissue. At the whole organ level, the size of the
                 computational mesh required makes their solution a
                 significant computational challenge. As the accuracy of
                 the numerical solution cannot be compromised, efficiency
                 of the solution technique is important to ensure that the
                 results of the simulation can be obtained in a reasonable
                 time while still encapsulating the complexities of the
                 system. In an attempt to increase efficiency of the
                 solver, the bidomain equations are often decoupled into
                 one parabolic equation that is computationally very cheap
                 to solve and an elliptic equation that is much more
                 expensive to solve. In this study, the performance of this

                 strategy in which the bidomain equations are solved as a

                 alternative method requires the solution of a much larger
                 linear system at each time step. However, in tests on two
                 3-D rabbit ventricle benchmarks, it is shown that the
                 coupled method is up to 80\% faster than the conventional
                 uncoupled method-and that parallel performance is better

                 spaces, and involves optimization, where one image
                 space is transformed into the other. Geometry-based
                 methods, which include using fiducial points and/or
                 surface-based techniques, are usually used for cardiac
                 image registration. During fiducial point registration,
                 fiducial points are either external skin markers or
                 manually determined by marking anatomical landmarks
                 using mapping catheters. Usually, a minimum of three
                 noncollinear points is needed for optimal registration.
                 During surface registration, each of the images'
                 surfaces are characterized to determine the best
                 transformation between them. Unlike the rigid body

                 cardiac motion during the cardiac cycle are specific to
                 cardiac image registration. This review addresses the

                 attention has shifted from class I agents that
                 primarily block sodium channels to class III agents
                 that primarily block potassium channels for
                 pharmacological management of certain cardiac
                 arrhythmias. Recent studies demonstrated that sodium
                 channel blockade, while antiarrhythmic at the cellular
                 level, was inherently proarrhythmic in the setting of a
                 propagating wave front as a result of prolongation of
                 the vulnerable period during which premature
                 stimulation can initiate reentrant activation. From a
                 theoretical perspective, sodium (depolarizing) and
                 potassium (repolarizing) currents are complementary so
                 that if antiarrhythmic and proarrhythmic properties are
                 coupled to modulation of sodium currents, then
                 antiarrhythmic and proarrhythmic properties might
                 similarly be coupled to modulation of potassium
                 currents. The purpose of the present study was to
                 explore the role of repolarization currents during
                 reentrant excitation. METHODS AND RESULTS: To assess
                 the generic role of repolarizing currents during
                 reentry, we studied the responses of a two-dimensional
                 array of identical excitable cells based on the
                 FitzHugh-Nagumo model, consisting of a single
                 excitation (sodium-like) current and a single recovery
                 (potassium-like) current. Spiral wave reentry was
                 initiated by use of S1S2 stimulation, with the delay
                 timed to occur within the vulnerable period (VP). While
                 holding the sodium conductance constant, the potassium
                 conductance (gK) was reduced from 1.13 to 0.70
                 (arbitrary units), producing a prolongation of the
                 action potential duration (APD). When gK was 1.13, the
                 tip of the spiral wave rotated around a small,
                 stationary, unexcited region and the computed ECG was
                 monomorphic. As gK was reduced, the APD was prolonged
                 and the unexcited region became mobile (nonstationary),
                 such that the tip of the spiral wave inscribed an
                 outline similar to a multipetaled flower;
                 concomitantly, the computed ECG became progressively
                 more polymorphic. The degree of polymorphism was
                 related to the APD and the configuration of the
                 nonstationary spiral core. CONCLUSIONS: Torsadelike
                 (polymorphic) ECGs can be derived from spiral wave
                 reentry in a medium of identical cells. Under normal
                 conditions, the spiral core around which a reentrant
                 wave front rotates is stationary. As the balance of
                 repolarizing currents becomes less outward (eg,
                 secondary to potassium channel blockade), the APD is
                 prolonged. When the wavelength (APD.velocity) exceeds
                 the perimeter of the stationary unexcited core, the
                 core will become unstable, causing spiral core drift.
                 Large repolarizing currents shorten the APD and result
                 in a monomorphic reentrant process (stationary core),
                 whereas smaller currents prolong the APD and amplify
                 spiral core instability, resulting in a polymorphic
                 process. We conclude that, similar to sodium channel
                 blockade, the proarrhythmic potential of potassium
                 channel blockade in the setting of propagation may be
                 directly linked to its cellular antiarrhythmic
                 potential, ie, arrhythmia suppression resulting from a
                 prolonged APD may, on initiation of a reentrant wave
                 front, destabilize the core of a rotating spiral,
                 resulting in complex motion (precession) of the spiral
                 tip around a nonstationary region of unexcited cells.
                 In tissue with inhomogeneities, core instability alters
                 the activation sequence from one reentry cycle to the
                 next and can lead to spiral wave fractination as the
                 wave front collides with inhomogeneous regions.
                 Depending on the nature of the inhomogeneities, wave
                 front fragments may annihilate one another, producing a
                 nonsustained arrhythmia, or may spawn new spirals
                 (multiple wavelets), producing fibrillation and sudden
                 cardiac death.",

                 line provocative test for ischemic heart disease
                 although it has a mean sensitivity of only 68\% and a
                 slightly higher specificity (77\%). The presence or
                 absence of chest pain in patients with an ischemic ST
                 response to exercise testing does not change the risk
                 of future ischemic events. However, ST depression
                 during the recovery period is associated with increased
                 risk both for acute coronary events and coronary death,
                 whereas silent ischemia during recovery is an even
                 stronger predictor than during exercise. The amplitude
                 of ST depression has not been documented to reflect the
                 magnitude of ischemia. Therefore, new methods are under
                 investigation such as adding R and Q wave amplitude
                 criteria, maximal ST/heart rate slope, linear
                 regression analysis of the heart rate related change in
                 ST depression and a score integrating ST segment
                 amplitude and slope changes. The demonstration of
                 episodic ST segment depressions in the ambulatory
                 setting, even without accompanying chest pain, are an
                 expression of transient ischemia and such episodes seem
                 to represent a poor prognosis. In the hospital setting,
                 ST depression detected by continuous monitoring is
                 related to the clinical outcome. ST segment monitoring
                 during the first 6-9 hours after coronary care unit
                 admission provides important prognostic information
                 on-line and considerably improves early risk
                 stratification. Such continuous ST monitoring overcomes
                 some of the limitations of static monitoring, as it
                 improves the likelihood of capturing the maximal point
                 of ST deviation, as well as early episodes of
                 reocclusion that are manifest as recurrent ST
                 elevation.",

  abstract =     "BACKGROUND: Expectations that reestablishing and
                 maintaining sinus rhythm in patients with atrial
                 fibrillation might improve survival were disproved in
                 the Atrial Fibrillation Follow-up Investigation of
                 Rhythm Management (AFFIRM) study. This report describes
                 the cause-specific modes of death in the AFFIRM
                 treatment groups. METHODS AND RESULTS: All deaths in
                 patients enrolled in AFFIRM underwent blinded review by
                 the AFFIRM Events Committee, and a mode of death was
                 assigned. In AFFIRM, 2033 patients were randomized to a
                 rhythm-control strategy and 2027 patients to a
                 rate-control strategy. During a mean follow-up of 3.5
                 years, there were 356 deaths in the rhythm-control
                 patients and 310 deaths in the rate-control patients
                 (P=0.07). In the rhythm-control group, 129 patients
                 (9\%) died of a cardiac cause, and in the rate-control
                 group, 130 patients (10\%) died (P=0.95). Both groups
                 had similar rates of arrhythmic and nonarrhythmic
                 cardiac deaths. The numbers of vascular deaths were
                 similar in the 2 groups: 35 (3\%) in the rhythm-control
                 group and 37 (3\%) in the rate-control group (P=0.82).
                 There were no differences in the rates of ischemic
                 stroke and central nervous system hemorrhage. In the
                 rhythm-control group, there were 169 noncardiovascular
                 deaths (47.5\% of the total number of deaths), whereas
                 in the rate-control arm, there were 113
                 noncardiovascular deaths (36.5\% of the total number of
                 deaths) (P=0.0008). Differences in noncardiovascular
                 death rates were due to pulmonary and cancer-related
                 deaths. CONCLUSIONS: Management of atrial fibrillation
                 with a rhythm-control strategy conferred no advantage
                 over a rate-control strategy in cardiac or vascular
                 mortality and may be associated with an increased
                 noncardiovascular death rate.",

                 whether patients with paroxysmal lone atrial fibrillation
                 (AF) have an abnormal atrial substrate. BACKGROUND: While
                 AF begets AF, prompt termination to prevent electrical
                 remodeling does not prevent disease progression. METHODS:
                 Twenty-five patients with paroxysmal lone AF, without
                 arrhythmia in the week prior, and 25 reference patients
                 with left-sided accessory pathways were studied.
                 Multipolar catheters placed at the lateral right atrium
                 (RA), crista terminalis, coronary sinus, septal RA, and
                 sequentially within the left atrium (LA) determined the
                 effective refractory period (ERP) at 10 sites, conduction
                 time along linear catheters, and conduction
                 characteristics at the crista terminalis. Bi-atrial
                 electroanatomic maps were created to determine regional
                 differences in conduction velocity and voltage. RESULTS:
                 Patients with AF demonstrated the following compared with
                 reference patients: larger atrial volumes (RA: 94 +/- 18
                 ml vs. 69 +/- 9 ml, p = 0.003; LA: 99 +/- 19 ml vs. 77 +/-
                 17 ml, p = 0.006); longer ERP (at 600 ms: 255 +/- 25 ms
                 vs. 222 +/- 16 ms, p < 0.001; at 450 ms: 234 +/- 20 ms vs.
                 212 +/- 14 ms, p = 0.004); longer conduction time along
                 linear catheters (57 +/- 18 ms vs. 47 +/- 10 ms, p =
                 0.01); longer bi-atrial activation time (128 +/- 17 ms vs.
                 89 +/- 10 ms, p < 0.001); slower conduction velocity (RA:
                 1.3 +/- 0.3 mm/ms vs. 2.1 +/- 0.5 mm/ms; LA: 1.2 +/- 0.2
                 mm/ms vs. 2.2 +/- 0.4 mm/ms, p < 0.001); greater
                 proportion of fractionated electrograms (27 +/- 8\% vs. 8
                 +/- 5\%, p < 0.001); longer corrected sinus node recovery
                 time (265 +/- 57 ms vs. 185 +/- 60 ms, p = 0.002); and
                 lower voltage (RA: 1.7 +/- 0.4 mV vs. 2.9 +/- 0.4 mV; LA:
                 1.7 +/- 0.7 mV vs. 3.3 +/- 0.7 mV, p < 0.001).
                 CONCLUSIONS: Patients with paroxysmal lone AF, remote from
                 arrhythmia, demonstrate bi-atrial abnormalities
                 characterized by structural change, conduction
                 abnormalities, and sinus node dysfunction. These factors
                 are likely contributors to the second factor that
                 predisposes to the development and progression of AF.",

                 three-dimensional sequence of repolarization and the
                 associated potential fields in the ventricles.
                 Knowledge of the sequence of repolarization has medical
                 relevance because high spatial dispersion of recovery
                 times and action potential durations favors cardiac
                 arrhythmias. In this study we describe measured and
                 simulated 3-D excitation and recovery sequences and
                 activation-recovery intervals (ARIs) (measured) or
                 action potential durations (APDs) (simulated) in the
                 ventricular walls. METHODS: We recorded from 600 to
                 1400 unipolar electrograms from canine ventricular
                 walls during atrial and ventricular pacing at 350-450
                 ms cycle length. Measured excitation and recovery times
                 and ARIs were displayed as 2-D maps in transmural
                 planes or 3-D maps in the volume explored, using
                 specially developed software. Excitation and recovery
                 sequences and APD distributions were also simulated in
                 parallelepipedal slabs using anisotropic monodomain or
                 bidomain models based on the Lou-Rudy version 1 model
                 with homogeneous membrane properties. RESULTS:
                 Simulations showed that in the presence of homogeneous
                 membrane properties, the sequence of repolarization was
                 similar but not identical to the excitation sequence.
                 In a transmural plane perpendicular to epicardial fiber
                 direction, both activation and recovery pathways
                 starting from an epicardial pacing site returned toward
                 the epicardium at a few cm distance from the pacing
                 site. However, APDs were not constant, but had a
                 dispersion of approximately 14 ms in the simulated
                 domain. The maximum APD value was near the pacing site
                 and two minima appeared along a line perpendicular to
                 fiber directions, passing through the pacing site.
                 Electrical measurements in dog ventricles showed that,
                 for short cycle lengths, both excitation and recovery
                 pathways, starting from an epicardial pacing site,
                 returned toward the epicardium. For slower pacing
                 rates, pathways of recovery departed from the pathway
                 of excitation. Highest ARI values were observed near
                 the pacing site in part of the experiments. In
                 addition, maps of activation-recovery intervals showed
                 mid-myocardial clusters with activation-recovery
                 intervals that were slightly longer than ARIs closer to
                 the epi- or endocardium, suggesting the presence of M
                 cells in those areas. Transmural dispersion of measured
                 ARIs was on the order of 20-25 ms. Potential
                 distributions during recovery were less affected by
                 myocardial anisotropy than were excitation
                 potentials.",

                 Twenty-four patients (15 with paroxysmal, 3 with
                 persistent, and 6 with permanent AF) underwent
                 endocardial mapping during AF. A 20-pole catheter with
                 five radiating spines was used to map both atria for 30
                 s in each of 10 pre-determined segments. A focal
                 activity was defined as > or =3 atrial cycles with
                 activation spreading from center to periphery of the
                 mapping catheter. Catheter ablation was performed
                 independent of the mapping results. RESULTS:
                 Spontaneous focal activities were observed in 13 sites
                 in the left atrium (9\%; anterior 1, roof 2, posterior
                 6, inferior 4) in 12 patients (9 paroxysmal, 3
                 persistent). Focal activity was observed continuously
                 (two sites) or intermittently (11 sites, median 5
                 episodes), and associated with shortening of the cycle
                 length (from 183 +/- 33 ms to 172 +/- 29 ms; p < 0.05).
                 The mean duration of an intermittent episode was 1.5 s
                 (range 0.4 to 7.1 s). Atrial fibrillation terminated
                 without ablation at the foci in all of 12 patients, but
                 in 2 of them, re-initiated arrhythmia was successfully
                 ablated at these foci. Nine of these 12 patients (75\%)
                 were arrhythmia-free without antiarrhythmic drugs
                 during a follow-up period of 7.0 +/- 3.1 months.
                 CONCLUSIONS: Termination of AF without ablation at the
                 sites of atrial focal activity suggests that this
                 activity may be triggered by impulses originating from
                 other regions, such as the pulmonary veins.",

  abstract =     "INTRODUCTION: We hypothesized that the frequency
                 spectra of fibrillatory electrograms may reflect the
                 complexity of activities perpetuating atrial
                 fibrillation (AF). To test this hypothesis, we
                 evaluated the frequency spectra in patients with
                 paroxysmal AF in relation to catheter ablation. METHODS
                 AND RESULTS: This study comprised two protocols: 25
                 patients undergoing pulmonary vein (PV) isolation in
                 protocol I, and 20 patients undergoing mitral isthmus
                 linear ablation after PV isolation in protocol II. The
                 mean of dominant frequency (DF) and organization index
                 (the ratio of the area under the DF and its harmonics
                 to the total power) were determined from 32-second
                 recordings in the coronary sinus. In protocol I, a PV
                 was considered driver of AF if isolation of the PV
                 resulted in termination or slowing of AF (decrease in
                 DF by > or =0.25 Hz). Twenty-one patients had AF
                 termination during four PV isolation. Among these 21
                 patients, 13 patients with single driving PV showed
                 significantly higher baseline organization index than
                 eight patients with multiple driving PVs (0.45 +/- 0.08
                 vs 0.35 +/- 0.07, P = 0.009). Patients with multiple
                 driving PVs showed a significant increase in the
                 organization index to 0.45 +/- 0.11 (P < 0.05) after
                 isolation of the initial driving PVs. In protocol II,
                 the baseline organization index was significantly
                 higher in seven patients who had termination of AF
                 during mitral isthmus ablation than 13 patients who did
                 not (0.50 +/- 0.10 vs 0.38 +/- 0.07, P < 0.008). The
                 baseline DF was not associated with outcomes of
                 ablation in both protocols. CONCLUSIONS: A higher
                 organization index of atrial electrograms is associated
                 with termination of AF during limited ablation. This
                 parameter may be useful to anticipate the extent of
                 ablation.",

                 presurgical evaluation during the lateralization and
                 localization of epileptogenic focus. Scalp EEG
                 epileptiform discharges may either guide direct surgical
                 intervention or provide necessary information to further
                 localize the epileptic focus with intracranial EEG
                 recording. Despite the importance and widespread use of
                 scalp EEG epileptiform discharges, the cortical EEG
                 substrates underlying these spikes and seizure discharges
                 are mostly speculative. Misconceptions are therefore
                 prevalent regarding the necessary cortical area,
                 synchrony, and amplitude required to generate those that
                 are recordable at the scalp. Using contemporary EEG
                 recording techniques such as simultaneous scalp and
                 intracranial EEG recording, the authors' recent studies
                 have shown that the cortical area of epileptiform
                 discharges required for the scalp recording is
                 considerably larger than commonly thought. A cortical area
                 of 10 to 20 cm is often required to generate a scalp
                 recognizable interictal spike or ictal rhythm. Sufficient
                 cortical source area and synchrony are mandatory factors
                 for the corresponding scalp EEG epileptiform recording.
                 The amplitude is primarily dependent on source area and
                 synchrony; therefore it is a less important factor. The
                 authors review the previous literatures in conjunction
                 with their recent investigations on this topic.",

                 electrode placement. To facilitate effective ICD

                 surface potential maps of ICD discharges during

                 body surface estimation algorithm. Comparison of the

                 this ST elevation is thought to be local inflammatory
                 changes in the epicardium underlying the inflamed
                 pericardium. The current from this area of ST elevation
                 must return to some unaffected region of the heart and
                 this should be associated with a region of ST
                 depression. This current path from the external
                 epicardial surface has been postulated to flow back
                 into the endocardium through the great vessels and
                 atria. To test this hypothesis, 18 patients with
                 pericarditis were studied by body surface potential
                 mapping and inverse epicardial potential distributions
                 were computed. The resultant maps were compared to
                 those of normal people and patients with acute anterior
                 infraction. Epicardial maps from patients with
                 pericarditis showed a region of current flow into the
                 heart over the great vessels and atria in all 18
                 patients. This pattern was not seen in normal patients
                 or infarction patients and was consistent with the
                 mechanism resulting in ST elevation in pericarditis
                 being one of current flowing from the epicardium out
                 into the thorax and back into the heart through the

                 epicardial contact electrograms or a summation of

                 virtual electrograms from the EnSite system with
                 unipolar contact electrograms from transmural plunge
                 needle electrodes using a 256-channel mapping system.
                 The study also evaluated the effects of differing
                 activation sites (endocardial, intramural, or
                 epicardial). A grid of 50-60 plunge needles was
                 positioned in the left ventricles of eight male sheep.
                 Correlations between contact and noncontact
                 electrograms were calculated on 32,242 electrograms.
                 Noncontact electrograms correlated equally well in
                 morphology and accuracy of timing with endocardial
                 (0.88 +/- 0.15), intramural (0.87 +/- 0.15), epicardial
                 (0.88 +/- 0.15), and transmural summation contact
                 electrograms (0.89 +/- 0.14) during sinus rhythm,
                 endocardial pacing, and epicardial pacing. There was a
                 nonlinear relationship between noncontact electrogram
                 accuracy as measured by correlation with the contact
                 electrogram and distance from the multielectrode array
                 (MEA): beyond 40 mm accuracy decreased rapidly. The
                 accuracy of noncontact electrograms also decreased with
                 increasing distance from the equator of the MEA.
                 Virtual electrograms from noncontact mapping of normal
                 left ventricles probably represent a summation of
                 transmural activation. Noncontact mapping has similar
                 accuracy with either endocardial or epicardial sites of
                 origin of electrical activity provided the MEA is
                 within 40 mm of the recording site.",

                 offers a good treatment option for AF, with reasonable
                 long-term results. The purpose of the present study was
                 to assess whether LA reverse remodeling occurs after
                 successful catheter ablation. Fifty-seven consecutive
                 patients (45 men; age 53 +/- 8 years) with symptomatic
                 drug-refractory AF were treated with radiofrequency
                 catheter ablation. The patients were divided into 2
                 groups on the basis of AF recurrence as determined by
                 Holter monitoring and 12-lead electrocardiographic
                 findings at 6 weeks and 3 months of follow-up (sinus
                 rhythm [SR] group, no recurrence; AF group, AF
                 recurrence). At baseline and 3 months of follow-up,
                 2-dimensional echocardiography was performed to assess
                 LA size and dimensions. Furthermore, LA volumes were
                 measured at end-systole and end-diastole. After 3
                 months, 39 of 57 patients (68\%) maintained SR. At 3
                 months of follow-up, the LA anteroposterior diameter
                 showed a significant reduction in the SR group (4.5+/-
                 0.3 vs 4.2 +/- 0.2 cm, p <0.01), and an additional
                 increase was observed in the AF group (4.5+/- 0.3 vs
                 4.8 +/- 0.3 cm, p <0.05). Furthermore, the LA
                 end-systolic and end-diastolic volumes decreased
                 significantly in the SR group from baseline to
                 follow-up (59 +/- 12 vs 50 +/- 11 ml, p <0.01, and 37
                 +/- 9 vs 31 +/- 7 ml, p <0.01, respectively). However,
                 a tendency toward an increase in LA volumes was
                 observed in the AF group. In conclusion, the results of
                 this study have demonstrated that LA reverse remodeling
                 occurs after successful radiofrequency catheter
                 ablation for AF.",

                 minimally invasive way to access membrane dynamics. The
                 biophysical factors underlying the genesis of this
                 signal, however, are still poorly understood. With the
                 use of data from a recent experimental study in a
                 murine heart, a three-dimensional anisotropic bidomain
                 model of the mouse ventricular free wall was developed
                 to study the currents and potentials resulting from the
                 application of a point mechanical load on cardiac
                 tissue. The applied pressure is assumed to open
                 nonspecific pressure-sensitive channels depolarizing
                 the membrane, leading to monophasic currents at the
                 electrode edge that give rise to the monophasic action
                 potential (MAP). The results show that the magnitude
                 and the time course of the MAP are reproduced only for
                 certain combinations of local or global intracellular
                 and interstitial resistances that form a resting tissue
                 length constant that, if applied over the entire
                 domain, is smaller than that required to match the wave
                 speed. The results suggest that the application of
                 pressure not only causes local depolarization but also
                 changes local tissue properties, both of which appear
                 to play a critical role in the genesis of the MAP.",

                 equations modeling cardiac electrical activity.
                 Classical finite difference methods have been applied
                 by many researchers to the bi-domain equations.
                 However, these methods suffer from the limitation of
                 requiring computational meshes that are structured and
                 orthogonal. Finite element or finite volume methods
                 enable the bi-domain equations to be solved on
                 unstructured meshes, although implementations of such
                 methods do not always cater for meshes with varying
                 element topology. The GFD method solves the bi-domain
                 equations on arbitrary and irregular computational
                 meshes without any need to specify element basis
                 functions. The method is useful as it can be easily
                 applied to activation problems using existing meshes
                 that have originally been created for use by finite
                 element or finite difference methods. In addition, the
                 GFD method employs an innovative approach to enforcing
                 nodal and non-nodal boundary conditions. The GFD method
                 performs effectively for a range of two and

                 activation, may contribute to arrhymogenesis and also

                 However, the influences of these mesoscale tissue

                 methodology for segmentation of left ventricular (LV)
                 infarct from clinically acquired, two-dimensional (2D),
                 late-gadolinium enhanced cardiac magnetic resonance
                 (LGE-CMR) images, for personalized modeling of ventricular
                 electrophysiology. The infarct segmentation was expressed
                 as a continuous min-cut optimization problem, which was
                 solved using its dual formulation, the continuous max-flow
                 (CMF). The optimization objective comprised of a
                 smoothness term, and a data term that quantified the
                 similarity between image intensity histograms of segmented
                 regions and those of a set of training images. A manual
                 segmentation of the LV myocardium was used to initialize
                 and constrain the developed method. The three-dimensional
                 geometry of infarct was reconstructed from its
                 segmentation using an implicit, shapebased interpolation

                 regarding the cardiovascular profile of terfenadine is
                 still limited, particularly in in vivo animal models.
                 In the current study, we examined the cardiovascular
                 effects of terfenadine using halothane-anesthetized,
                 closed-chest in vivo canine models (n = 6) to better
                 simulate the clinical situation. Intravenous infusion
                 of 0.3 mg/kg of terfenadine over 10 min, which would
                 attain the antihistaminic plasma concentration, reduced
                 the heart rate and left ventricular contractility and
                 prolonged the repolarization period as well as the
                 ventricular effective refractory period. An additional
                 infusion of a ten times higher dose of terfenadine over
                 10 min caused hypotension and increased left
                 ventricular preload and atrioventricular conduction
                 time, in addition to potentiating the changes observed
                 by the lower dose. A reverse use-dependent prolongation
                 of the repolarization period was observed after the
                 higher dose infusion. Moreover, early
                 afterdepolarization-like potential was detected in four
                 out of six experiments. Since each suppressive effect
                 can become deleterious during terfenadine overdose,
                 caution must be taken for those patients with potential
                 cardiac dysfunction and with the risk of elevated
                 plasma drug concentrations.",

                 widely used primary preventive care for sudden cardiac
                 death (SCD). Current clinical practice of using a
                 left-ventricular ejection fraction threshold as the sole
                 criterion for defibrillator insertion results in many

                 cardiac magnetic resonance images that can predict SCD

                 geometries. An accurate representation of ventricular
                 geometry and fiber orientations was reconstructed,
                 respectively, from high-resolution ex vivo structural
                 magnetic resonance (MR) and diffusion tensor (DT) MR
                 images of a normal human heart, referred to as the atlas.
                 Ventricular geometry of a patient heart was extracted, via
                 semiautomatic segmentation, from an in vivo computed
                 tomography (CT) image. Using image transformation
                 algorithms, the atlas ventricular geometry was deformed to
                 match that of the patient. Finally, the deformation field
                 was applied to the atlas fiber orientations to obtain an
                 estimate of patient fiber orientations. The accuracy of
                 the fiber estimates was assessed using six normal and

                 resonance imaging and computational anatomy tools, a novel
                 computational framework to compare 3-dimensional LV
                 endocardial surface curvedness, wall thickness, and
                 relative wall thickness between patient groups was

                 resonance data of 61 patients with ischemic cardiomyopathy
                 who were selected for prophylactic implantable
                 cardioverter-defibrillator treatment on the basis of
                 reduced LVEF. Compared with patients with no

                 quantifiable differences in 3-dimensional endocardial
                 surface curvedness, LV wall thickness, and LV relative

                 therapeutic goal in patients with atrial fibrillation.
                 However, recurrences of atrial fibrillation and side
                 effects of antiarrhythmic drugs offset the benefits of
                 sinus rhythm. We hypothesized that ventricular rate
                 control is not inferior to the maintenance of sinus
                 rhythm for the treatment of atrial fibrillation.
                 METHODS: We randomly assigned 522 patients who had
                 persistent atrial fibrillation after a previous
                 electrical cardioversion to receive treatment aimed at
                 rate control or rhythm control. Patients in the
                 rate-control group received oral anticoagulant drugs
                 and rate-slowing medication. Patients in the
                 rhythm-control group underwent serial cardioversions
                 and received antiarrhythmic drugs and oral
                 anticoagulant drugs. The end point was a composite of
                 death from cardiovascular causes, heart failure,
                 thromboembolic complications, bleeding, implantation of
                 a pacemaker, and severe adverse effects of drugs.
                 RESULTS: After a mean (+/-SD) of 2.3+/-0.6 years, 39
                 percent of the 266 patients in the rhythm-control group
                 had sinus rhythm, as compared with 10 percent of the
                 256 patients in the rate-control group. The primary end
                 point occurred in 44 patients (17.2 percent) in the
                 rate-control group and in 60 (22.6 percent) in the
                 rhythm-control group. The 90 percent (two-sided) upper
                 boundary of the absolute difference in the primary end
                 point was 0.4 percent (the prespecified criterion for
                 noninferiority was 10 percent or less). The
                 distribution of the various components of the primary
                 end point was similar in the rate-control and
                 rhythm-control groups. CONCLUSIONS: Rate control is not
                 inferior to rhythm control for the prevention of death

                 used for treatment of atrial fibrillation, but its
                 long-term efficacy has not been determined
                 prospectively. OBJECTIVES: To determine the long-term
                 success rate of the serial electrical cardioversion
                 approach in patients with chronic atrial fibrillation,
                 to identify factors that predict its success, and to
                 assess the efficacy and safety of oral anticoagulation
                 in these patients. METHODS: Patients with chronic (> 24
                 hours) atrial fibrillation received anticoagulant
                 therapy for at least 4 weeks prior to electrical
                 cardioversion. No prophylactic antiarrhythmic agent was
                 given after the first shock. Relapses were managed by
                 using repeated cardioversions, after which serial
                 antiarrhythmic drug therapy was started. Treatment with
                 anticoagulants was withdrawn after 4 weeks of sinus
                 rhythm. RESULTS: Two hundred thirty-six patients were
                 followed up for a mean +/- SD of 3.7 +/- 1.6 years. The
                 actuarial cumulative percentages of patients who
                 maintained sinus rhythm after serial cardioversion
                 treatment was 42\% and 27\% after 1 and 4 years,
                 respectively. Multivariate analysis showed that factors
                 that were associated with failure of this approach
                 included duration of atrial fibrillation that exceeded
                 36 months (risk ratio, 5.0; P <.001), poor exercise
                 tolerance (functional class III; risk ratio, 1.8; P
                 =.001), and age older than 56 years (risk ratio, 1.5; P
                 =.04). The anticoagulation level (international
                 normalized ratio, 2.4-4.8) was associated with an
                 incidence of thromboembolic events and bleeding
                 complications of 0.2\% and 1.5\%, respectively.
                 CONCLUSIONS: Many patients with chronic atrial
                 fibrillation failed to respond to the serial electrical
                 cardioversion strategy. However, in younger patients
                 with a fair exercise tolerance and a duration of atrial
                 fibrillation shorter than 36 months, this approach may
                 be worthwhile. In addition, thromboembolic events were
                 infrequent in the patients who were subjected to this

                 characterization of electrical substrate and its

                 method. The 14.8-billion bp DNA sequence was generated

                 each combining sequence data from Celera and the
                 publicly funded genome effort. The public data were

                 size of gaps in the final assembly over what would be
                 obtained with 5.11-fold coverage. The two assembly

                 veins (PVs) has been proposed as a mechanism for focal
                 atrial fibrillation. The way in which the myocardial
                 sleeve inside PVs can form a substrate for focal
                 activity is not well understood. Therefore, we have
                 studied tissue structure and connexin distribution at
                 the veno-atrial transition in the dog. METHODS: In
                 adult mongrel dogs, the anatomy of the PV area was
                 studied. Tissue structure in individual veins was
                 assessed in formalin fixed sections using Masson's
                 Trichrome staining. Gap junction protein distribution
                 was examined using antibodies against connexin40 (Cx40)
                 and connexin43 (Cx43). The ultrastructure of myocytes
                 in myocardial sleeves was studied using electron
                 microscopy. RESULTS: Individual PVs in the dog had a
                 gross morphology similar to that observed in the human,
                 with myocardial sleeves extending into the veins for
                 4-20 mm. In all veins examined, myocytes in myocardial
                 sleeves had a normal atrial morphology and anti-desmin
                 staining pattern. Cx43 was expressed throughout the
                 sleeve at levels comparable to normal atrial
                 myocardium. By contrast, Cx40 expression was lower in
                 myocardial sleeves than in the rest of the left atrium.
                 Myocytes in the sleeve, which were ultrastructurally
                 similar to normal atrial myocytes, were predominantly
                 organized in a circumferential pattern. CONCLUSIONS:
                 PVs in the dog and various canine models of heart
                 disease will be a suitable model for (patho)physiology
                 of the veno-atrial transition. Myocytes in myocardial
                 sleeves are similar to normal atrial myocytes. The
                 circumferential orientation of these myocytes may
                 provide a substrate for rapid circular reentry.",

                 associated with an increased incidence of atrial
                 fibrillation (AF), but the underlying mechanism is not
                 clear. We have investigated atrial electrophysiology
                 and tissue structure in a canine model of chronic
                 atrial dilatation due to mitral regurgitation (MR).
                 METHODS AND RESULTS: Thirteen control and 19 MR dogs (1
                 month after partial mitral valve avulsion) were
                 studied. Dogs in the MR group were monitored using
                 echocardiography and Holter recording. In open-chest
                 follow-up experiments, electrode arrays were placed on
                 the atria to investigate conduction patterns, effective
                 refractory periods, and inducibility of AF. Alterations
                 in tissue structure and ultrastructure were assessed in
                 atrial tissue samples. At follow-up, left atrial length
                 in MR dogs was 4.09+/-0.45 cm, compared with
                 3.25+/-0.28 at baseline (P<0.01), corresponding to a
                 volume of 205+/-61\% of baseline. At follow-up, no
                 differences in atrial conduction pattern and conduction
                 velocities were noted between control and MR dogs.
                 Effective refractory periods were increased
                 homogeneously throughout the left and right atrium.
                 Sustained AF (>1 hour) was inducible in 10 of 19 MR
                 dogs and none of 13 control dogs (P<0.01). In the
                 dilated MR left atrium, areas of increased interstitial
                 fibrosis and chronic inflammation were accompanied by
                 increased glycogen ultrastructurally. CONCLUSIONS:
                 Chronic atrial dilatation in the absence of overt heart
                 failure leads to an increased vulnerability to AF that
                 is not based on a decrease in wavelength.",

                 most effective. At our center, we have developed a
                 technique for isolating the pulmonary veins (PVs) at
                 their antrum. The technique is guided by intracardiac
                 echocardiography (ICE) and mapping with a circular
                 (Lasso) catheter. Our technique was developed based on
                 four crucial principles: 1. Precisely identifying the
                 true border of the PV antrum. 2. Electrically isolating
                 all of the PVs at the level of the antrum. 3. Avoiding
                 risk of PV stenosis by ablating outside of the antrum.
                 4. Minimizing risk of other complications, such as
                 perforation and stroke, by direct visualization during
                 transseptal access and radiofrequency (RF) ablation.",

                 by either refractory ventricular tachycardia (VT) or
                 ventricular fibrillation (VF). However, little is known
                 about the prevalence, predictors, and mortality
                 implications of the causative arrhythmia in ES. We
                 sought to assess the prevalence, predictors, and
                 survival significance of VT and VF as the causative
                 arrhythmia of ES in implantable cardioverter
                 defibrillator (ICD) patients. METHODS AND RESULTS:
                 Consecutive patients from January 2000 to December 2002
                 who presented to the ICD clinic with > or = 2 separate
                 ventricular arrhythmic episodes requiring shock within
                 24 hours were included in the study. ICD interrogation
                 confirmed the number of shocks and provided
                 electrograms for interpretation of the causative
                 arrhythmia. Patients were grouped as VF or VT according
                 to the causative arrhythmia. Their prevalence,
                 predictors, and mortality rates were compared. Of 2,028
                 patients assessed in the ICD clinic, 208 (10\%)
                 presented with ES. VF was the cause of ES in 99 of 208
                 patients, for an overall prevalence of 48\%. Original
                 ICD indication, coronary artery disease, and amiodarone
                 therapy were predictive for the causative arrhythmia.
                 There was no mortality difference between the VT and VF
                 groups; however, both groups had significantly
                 increased mortality compared to a control ICD
                 population without ES. CONCLUSION: VF is the causative
                 arrhythmia for a sizable proportion of patients with
                 ES. The initial ICD indication, coronary artery
                 disease, and amiodarone therapy are predictors of the
                 causative arrhythmias in ES. There does not appear to
                 be any mortality difference between ES patients with VT
                 and VF, but mortality is increased in patients with ES
                 versus control ICD patients without ES.",

                 and patients who had recurrent AF despite
                 antiarrhythmic medication (group III) after PV antrum
                 isolation (PVAI). METHODS AND RESULTS: PV conduction
                 was examined in consecutive patients undergoing second
                 PVAI for AF recurrence. We also recruited some patients
                 cured of AF to undergo a repeat, limited
                 electrophysiological study at >3 months after PVAI. All
                 patients underwent PVAI with an intracardiac
                 echocardiography (ICE)-guided approach with complete
                 isolation of all 4 PV antra (PVA). The number of PVs
                 with recurrent conduction and the shortest atrial to PV
                 (A-PV) conduction delay was measured with the use of
                 consistent Lasso positions defined by ICE. Late AF
                 recurrence was defined as AF >2 months after PVAI with
                 the patient off medications. Patients in groups I
                 (n=26), II (n=37), and III (n=44) did not differ at
                 baseline (38\% permanent AF; ejection fraction
                 53+/-6\%). Recurrence of PV-left atrial (LA) conduction
                 was seen in 1.7+/-0.8 and 2.2+/-0.8 PVAs for groups II
                 and III but only in 0.2+/-0.4 for group I (P=0.02). In
                 patients with recurrent PV-LA conduction, the A-PV
                 delay increased from the first to second procedure by
                 69+/-47\% for group III, 267+/-110\% for group II, and
                 473+/-71\% for group I (P<0.001). When pacing was at a
                 faster rate, A-PV block developed in all 5 of the group
                 I patients with recurrent PV-LA conduction.
                 CONCLUSIONS: The majority of patients with drug-free
                 cure show no PV-LA conduction recurrence. Substantial
                 A-PV delay is seen in patients able to maintain sinus
                 rhythm on antiarrhythmic medication or cured of AF
                 compared with patients who fail PVAI.",

                 impact of left atrial scarring (LAS) on the outcome of
                 patients undergoing pulmonary vein antrum isolation
                 (PVAI) for atrial fibrillation (AF). BACKGROUND: Left
                 atrial scarring may be responsible for both the
                 perpetuation and genesis of AF. METHODS: A total of 700
                 consecutive patients undergoing first-time PVAI were
                 studied. Before ablation, extensive voltage mapping of
                 the left atrium (LA) was performed using a multipolar
                 Lasso catheter guided by intracardiac echocardiography
                 (ICE). Patients with LAS were defined by a complete
                 absence of electrographic recording by a circular
                 mapping catheter in multiple LA locations, and this was
                 validated by electroanatomic mapping. All four
                 pulmonary vein antra and the superior vena cava were
                 isolated using an ICE-guided technique. Patients were
                 followed at least nine months for late AF recurrence.
                 Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to
                 assess the predictive value of LAS and other variables
                 on outcome. RESULTS: Of 700 patients, 42 had LAS, which
                 represented 21 +/- 11\% of the LA surface area by
                 electroanatomic mapping. Patients with LAS had a
                 significantly higher AF recurrence (57\%) compared with
                 non-LAS patients (19\%, p = 0.003). Also, LAS was
                 associated with a significantly larger LA size, lower
                 ejection fraction, and higher C-reactive protein
                 levels. Univariate analysis revealed age, nonparoxysmal
                 AF, and LAS as predictors of recurrence. Multivariate
                 analysis showed LAS as the only independent predictor
                 of recurrence (hazard ratio 3.4, 95\% confidence
                 interval 1.3 to 9.4; p = 0.01). CONCLUSIONS:
                 Pre-existent LAS in patients undergoing PVAI for AF is
                 a powerful, independent predictor of procedural
                 failure. Left atrial scarring is associated with a
                 lower EF, larger LA size, and increased inflammatory
                 markers.",

                 infarction (MI). We sought to assess the relationship
                 between successful ablation sites of hemodynamically
                 stable post-MI VTs determined by mapping during VT with
                 the scar border zone defined in sinus rhythm. METHODS
                 AND RESULTS: Forty-six patients presenting with

                 and who had at least one such VT successfully ablated
                 were prospectively included in the study. In each
                 patient, VT was ablated by targeting regions during VT
                 that exhibited early activation, +/- isolated
                 mid-diastolic potentials, and concealed entrainment
                 suggesting a critical isthmus site. Prior to ablation,
                 a detailed sinus-rhythm CARTO voltage map of the left
                 ventricle was obtained. A voltage <0.5 mV defined dense
                 scar. Successful VT ablation sites were registered on
                 the sinus voltage map to assess their relationship to
                 the scar border zone. Of the 86 VTs, 68\% were
                 successfully ablated at sites in the endocardial border
                 zone. The remaining VTs had ablation sites within the
                 scar in (18\%), in normal myocardium (4\%), and on the
                 epicardial surface (10\%). There were no significant
                 differences in VT recurrence amongst the different
                 groups. CONCLUSION: Successful ablation sites of
                 hemodynamically stable, monomorphic VTs post-MI are
                 often located in the scar border zone as defined by
                 substrate voltage mapping. However, in a sizable
                 minority, ablation sites are located within endocardial
                 scar, epicardially, and even in normal myocardium.",

                 genotype and phenotype positive LQTS underwent ECG
                 imaging. Seven normal subjects provided control.

                 activation-recovery intervals, and repolarization
                 dispersion were constructed. Activation was normal in all

                 intervals were prolonged relative to control, indicating
                 delayed repolarization and abnormally long action
                 potential duration (312+/-30 ms versus 235+/-21 ms in

                 Cox maze procedure for the surgical treatment of atrial
                 fibrillation. This study evaluated the safety and efficacy
                 of a new bipolar radiofrequency ablation device for atrial
                 ablation in a long-term porcine model. METHODS: Six pigs
                 underwent a Cox maze IV procedure on a beating heart off
                 cardiopulmonary bypass using the AtriCure Isolator II
                 bipolar ablation device (AtriCure, Inc, Cincinnati, Ohio).
                 In addition, 6 pigs underwent median sternotomy and
                 pericardiotomy alone to serve as a control group. All
                 animals were allowed to survive for 30 days. Each pig
                 underwent induction of atrial fibrillation and was then
                 humanely killed to remove the heart en bloc for histologic
                 assessment. Magnetic resonance imaging scans were also
                 obtained preoperatively and postoperatively to assess
                 atrial and ventricular function, pulmonary vein anatomy,
                 valve function, and coronary artery patency. RESULTS: All
                 animals survived the operation. Electrical isolation of
                 the left atrial appendage and the pulmonary veins was
                 documented by pacing acutely and at 30 days in all
                 animals. No animal that underwent the Cox maze IV
                 procedure was able to be induced into atrial fibrillation
                 at 30 days postoperatively, compared with all the sham
                 animals. All 257 ablations examined were discrete, linear,
                 and transmural, with a mean lesion width of 2.2 +/- 1.1 mm
                 and a mean lesion depth of 5.3 +/- 3.0 mm. CONCLUSIONS:
                 The AtriCure Isolator II device was able to create
                 reliable long-term transmural lesions of the modified Cox
                 maze procedure on a beating heart without cardiopulmonary

                 model the head volume conductor as realistic as possible.
                 This includes the distinction of the different conductive
                 compartments in the human head. In this study, we
                 investigated the influence of modeling/not modeling the
                 conductive compartments skull spongiosa, skull compacta,
                 cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), gray matter, and white matter
                 and of the inclusion of white matter anisotropy on the
                 EEG/MEG forward solution. Therefore, we created a highly
                 realistic 6-compartment head model with white matter
                 anisotropy and used a state-of-the-art finite element
                 approach. Starting from a 3-compartment scenario (skin,
                 skull, and brain), we subsequently refined our head model
                 by distinguishing one further of the above-mentioned
                 compartments. For each of the generated five head models,
                 we measured the effect on the signal topography and signal
                 magnitude both in relation to a highly resolved reference
                 model and to the model generated in the previous
                 refinement step. We evaluated the results of these
                 simulations using a variety of visualization methods,
                 allowing us to gain a general overview of effect strength,
                 of the most important source parameters triggering these
                 effects, and of the most affected brain regions. Thereby,
                 starting from the 3-compartment approach, we identified
                 the most important additional refinement steps in head
                 volume conductor modeling. We were able to show that the
                 inclusion of the highly conductive CSF compartment, whose
                 conductivity value is well known, has the strongest
                 influence on both signal topography and magnitude in both
                 modalities. We found the effect of gray/white matter
                 distinction to be nearly as big as that of the CSF
                 inclusion, and for both of these steps we identified a
                 clear pattern in the spatial distribution of effects. In
                 comparison to these two steps, the introduction of white
                 matter anisotropy led to a clearly weaker, but still
                 strong, effect. Finally, the distinction between skull
                 spongiosa and compacta caused the weakest effects in both
                 modalities when using an optimized conductivity value for
                 the homogenized compartment. We conclude that it is highly
                 recommendable to include the CSF and distinguish between
                 gray and white matter in head volume conductor modeling.
                 Especially for the MEG, the modeling of skull spongiosa
                 and compacta might be neglected due to the weak effects;
                 the simplification of not modeling white matter anisotropy
                 is admissible considering the complexity and current
                 limitations of the underlying modeling approach.",

                 Experiments were performed in anesthetized dogs that
                 had been in chronic atrioventricular block for 9 +/- 6
                 weeks. TdP inducibility was attempted using different

                 mg/kg d-sotalol. d-Sotalol increased the cycle length

                 transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) and present
                 a guideline for efficient and yet accurate volume
                 conductor modeling in tDCS using our newly-developed
                 finite element (FE) approach. APPROACH: We developed a
                 new, accurate and fast isoparametric FE approach for
                 high-resolution geometry-adapted hexahedral meshes and
                 tissue anisotropy. To attain a deeper insight into tDCS,
                 we performed computer simulations, starting with a
                 homogenized three-compartment head model and extending
                 this step by step to a six-compartment anisotropic model.
                 MAIN RESULTS: We are able to demonstrate important tDCS
                 effects. First, we find channeling effects of the skin,
                 the skull spongiosa and the cerebrospinal fluid
                 compartments. Second, current vectors tend to be oriented
                 towards the closest higher conducting region. Third,
                 anisotropic WM conductivity causes current flow in
                 directions more parallel to the WM fiber tracts. Fourth,
                 the highest cortical current magnitudes are not only found
                 close to the stimulation sites. Fifth, the median brain
                 current density decreases with increasing distance from
                 the electrodes. SIGNIFICANCE: Our results allow us to
                 formulate a guideline for volume conductor modeling in
                 tDCS. We recommend to accurately model the major tissues
                 between the stimulating electrodes and the target areas,
                 while for efficient yet accurate modeling, an exact
                 representation of other tissues is less important. Because
                 for the low-frequency regime in electrophysiology the

                 either a 'top-down' or 'bottom-up' approach. However,
                 neither approach takes account of heterogeneity or
                 'noise', which is an inherent feature of cellular
                 behaviour and may have significant impact on system level
                 behaviour. We review existing approaches to modelling that
                 use cellular automata or agent-based methodologies, where
                 individual cells are represented as equivalent virtual
                 entities governed by simple rules. These paradigms allow a
                 direct one-to-one mapping between real and virtual cells
                 that can be exploited in terms of acquiring parameters
                 from experimental systems, or for model validation. Such
                 models are inherently extensible and can be integrated
                 with other modelling modalities (e.g. partial or ordinary
                 differential equations) to model multi-scale phenomena.
                 Alternatively, hierarchical agent models may be used to
                 explore the functions of biological systems across
                 temporal and spatial scales. This review examines
                 individual-based models and the application of the
                 paradigm to explore multi-scale phenomena in biology. In
                 so doing, it demonstrates how cellular-based models have
                 begun to play an important role in the development of
                 'middle-out' models, but with considerable potential for

  abstract =     "BACKGROUND: Atrial fibrillation (AF) and congestive
                 heart failure (CHF) frequently occur together, but
                 there is limited information regarding their temporal
                 relations and the combined influence of these
                 conditions on mortality. METHODS AND RESULTS: We
                 studied participants in the Framingham Study with
                 new-onset AF or CHF. Multivariable Cox proportional
                 hazards models with time-dependent variables were used
                 to evaluate whether mortality after AF or CHF was
                 affected by the occurrence and timing of the other
                 condition. Hazard ratios (HRs) were adjusted for time
                 period and cardiovascular risk factors. During the
                 study period, 1470 participants developed AF, CHF, or
                 both. Among 382 individuals with both conditions, 38\%
                 had AF first, 41\% had CHF first, and 21\% had both
                 diagnosed on the same day. The incidence of CHF among
                 AF subjects was 33 per 1000 person-years, and the
                 incidence of AF among CHF subjects was 54 per 1000
                 person-years. In AF subjects, the subsequent
                 development of CHF was associated with increased
                 mortality (men: HR 2.7; 95\% CI, 1.9 to 3.7; women: HR
                 3.1; 95\% CI, 2.2 to 4.2). Similarly, in CHF subjects,
                 later development of AF was associated with increased
                 mortality (men: HR 1.6; 95\% CI, 1.2 to 2.1; women: HR
                 2.7, 95\% CI, 2.0 to 3.6). Preexisting CHF adversely
                 affected survival in individuals with AF, but
                 preexisting AF was not associated with adverse survival
                 in those with CHF. CONCLUSIONS: Individuals with AF or
                 CHF who subsequently develop the other condition have a
                 poor prognosis. Additional studies addressing the
                 pathogenesis, prevention, and optimal management of the
                 joint occurrence of AF and CHF appear warranted.",

                 used 12-lead electrocardiogram, which provides only global
                 information, and ECGI has distinct advantages over the
                 currently used method of mapping with invasive
                 catheter-applied electrodes. The spatial resolution of
                 this method and its ability to image electrical activation
                 sequences over the entire ventricular surfaces in a single
                 heartbeat allowed us to determine VT initiation sites and
                 continuation pathways, as well as VT relationships to
                 ventricular substrates, including anatomical scars and
                 abnormal electrophysiological substrate. Thus, ECGI can
                 map the VT activation sequence and identify the location
                 and depth of VT origin in individual patients, allowing
                 personalized treatment of patients with ventricular

                 conduction model, we studied the inverse
                 electrocardiographic problem of computing the
                 transmembrane potentials (TMPs) throughout the myocardium
                 from a body-surface potential map, and then used the
                 recovered potentials to localize myocardial ischemia. Our
                 main contribution is solving the inverse problem within a
                 constrained optimization framework, which is a
                 generalization of previous methods for calculating
                 transmembrane potentials. The framework offers ample
                 flexibility for users to apply various
                 physiologically-based constraints, and is well supported
                 by mature algorithms and solvers developed by the
                 optimization community. By avoiding the traditional
                 inverse ECG approach of building the lead-field matrix,
                 the framework greatly reduces computation cost and, by
                 setting the associated forward problem as a constraint,
                 the framework enables one to flexibly set individualized
                 resolutions for each physical variable, a desirable
                 feature for balancing model accuracy, ill-conditioning and
                 computation tractability. Although the task of computing
                 myocardial TMPs at an arbitrary time instance remains an
                 open problem, we showed that it is possible to obtain TMPs
                 with moderate accuracy during the ST segment by assuming
                 all cardiac cells are at the plateau phase. Moreover, the
                 calculated TMPs yielded a good estimate of ischemic
                 regions, which was of more clinical interest than the
                 voltage values themselves. We conducted finite element
                 simulations of a phantom experiment over a 2D torso model
                 with synthetic ischemic data. Preliminary results
                 indicated that our approach is feasible and suitably
                 accurate for the common case of transmural myocardial
                 ischemia.",

                 approximation of the inverse problem when the
                 finite-element method is used. Being ill-posed, the
                 inverse problem requires different discretization
                 strategies from its corresponding forward problem. We
                 propose refinement guidelines that specifically address
                 the ill-posedness of the problem. The resulting guidelines
                 necessitate the use of hybrid finite elements composed of
                 tetrahedra and prism elements. Also, in order to maintain
                 consistent numerical quality when the inverse problem is
                 discretized into different scales, we propose a new family
                 of regularizers using the variational principle underlying
                 finite-element methods. These variational-formed
                 regularizers serve as an alternative to the traditional
                 Tikhonov regularizers, but preserves the L(2) norm and
                 thereby achieves consistent regularization in multiscale
                 simulations. The variational formulation also enables a
                 simple construction of the discrete gradient operator over
                 irregular meshes, which is difficult to define in
                 traditional discretization schemes. We validated our
                 hybrid element technique and the variational regularizers
                 by simulations on a realistic 3-D torso/heart model with
                 empirical heart data. Results show that discretization
                 based on our proposed strategies mitigates the
                 ill-conditioning and improves the inverse solution, and
                 that the variational formulation may benefit a broader

                 techniques have enabled biologists to place large amounts
                 of volume data from fluorescence microscopy, morphed
                 three-dimensionally, onto a common spatial frame. Existing
                 tools built on volume visualization pipelines for single
                 channel or red-green-blue (RGB) channels have become
                 inadequate for the new challenges of fluorescence
                 microscopy. For a three-dimensional atlas of the insect
                 nervous system, hundreds of volume channels are rendered
                 simultaneously, whereas fluorescence intensity values from
                 each channel need to be preserved for versatile adjustment
                 and analysis. Although several existing tools have
                 incorporated support of multichannel data using various
                 strategies, the lack of a flexible design has made true
                 many-channel visualization and analysis unavailable. The
                 most common practice for many-channel volume data
                 presentation is still converting and rendering
                 pseudosurfaces, which are inaccurate for both qualitative
                 and quantitative evaluations. RESULTS: Here, we present an
                 alternative design strategy that accommodates the
                 visualization and analysis of about 100 volume channels,
                 each of which can be interactively adjusted, selected, and
                 segmented using freehand tools. Our multichannel
                 visualization includes a multilevel streaming pipeline
                 plus a triple-buffer compositing technique. Our method
                 also preserves original fluorescence intensity values on
                 graphics hardware, a crucial feature that allows
                 graphics-processing-unit (GPU)-based processing for
                 interactive data analysis, such as freehand segmentation.
                 We have implemented the design strategies as a thorough
                 restructuring of our original tool, FluoRender.
                 CONCLUSION: The redesign of FluoRender not only maintains
                 the existing multichannel capabilities for a greatly
                 extended number of volume channels, but also enables new
                 analysis functions for many-channel data from emerging

                 SCN1B is associated with Brugada syndrome and isolated
                 cardiac conduction disease. We tested the hypothesis that
                 mutations in the 4 sodium channel beta-subunit genes
                 SCN1B-SCN4B contribute to AF susceptibility. METHODS AND
                 RESULTS: Screening for mutations in the 4 beta-subunit
                 genes was performed in 480 patients with AF (118 patients
                 with lone AF and 362 patients with AF and cardiovascular
                 disease) and 548 control subjects (188 ethnically defined
                 anonymized subjects and 360 subjects without AF). The
                 effects of mutant beta-subunits on SCN5A mediated currents
                 were studied using electrophysiological studies. We
                 identified 2 nonsynonymous variants in SCN1B (resulting in
                 R85H, D153N) and 2 in SCN2B (R28Q, R28W) in patients with
                 AF. These occur at residues highly conserved across
                 mammals and were absent in control subjects. In 3 of 4
                 mutation carriers, the ECGs showed saddleback-type
                 ST-segment elevation in the right precordial leads.
                 Transcripts encoding both SCN1B and SCN2B were detected in
                 human atrium and ventricle. In heterologous expression
                 studies using Chinese hamster ovary cells, the mutant
                 beta1- or beta2-subunits reduced SCN5A-mediated current

                 wild-type subunits. CONCLUSIONS: Loss of function
                 mutations in sodium channel beta-subunits were identified
                 in patients with AF and were associated with a distinctive
                 ECG phenotype. These findings further support the
                 hypothesis that decreased sodium current enhances AF

                 fibrillation (AF) frequently coexist in the same
                 patient. Recently it has been demonstrated that the
                 triggers for both AF and AFL may originate in the
                 pulmonary veins (PVs). We hypothesized that in patients
                 with both AF and typical AFL, pulmonary vein-left
                 atrial junction (PV-LAJ) disconnection may eliminate
                 both arrhythmias. METHODS AND RESULTS: Consecutive
                 patients with documented symptomatic AF and typical AFL
                 were randomly assigned to have PV-LAJ disconnection
                 combined with cavotricuspid isthmus (CTI) ablation
                 (group 1, n=49) or PV-LAJ disconnection alone (group 2,
                 n=59). Within the first 8 weeks after ablation, 32 of
                 the group 2 patients had typical AFL documented,
                 whereas none was seen in group 1. Twenty of these 32
                 converted to sinus rhythm after initiating
                 antiarrhythmic drugs (AADs). Twelve were cardioverted,
                 and AADs were started. After 8 weeks, all AADS were
                 stopped, and only 3 patients continued to have
                 recurrent sustained typical AFL that was eliminated by
                 CTI ablation. Beyond 8 weeks of follow-up, 7 patients
                 in group 1 and 6 patients in group 2 (14\% and 11\%,
                 respectively) continued to have AF. Ten of these 13
                 patients underwent a repeat PV-LAJ disconnection
                 procedure and were cured. The remaining 3 remained in
                 normal sinus rhythm while taking AADs. CONCLUSIONS: In
                 patients with both AFL and AF, PV-LAJ disconnection
                 alone may be sufficient to control both arrhythmias.
                 CTI block reduced early postablation recurrence of
                 arrhythmias, which in the majority of patients reflects
                 a short-term clinical problem.",

                 the incidence of char formation and embolic events with
                 different anticoagulation protocols prospectively
                 changed to reduce such complication. METHODS: A total
                 of 785 patients (mean age: 54 years, 83.5\% male)
                 underwent catheter-based PVI for treatment of drug
                 refractory, symptomatic atrial fibrillation (AF). PVI
                 was performed utilizing different strategies including
                 radiofrequency (RF) using temperature control energy
                 delivery and RF using intracardiac echocardiography
                 (ICE)-guided power titration. Patients were divided
                 based on the anticoagulation protocol into three
                 groups: in group 1 (194 patients), activation
                 coagulation time (ACT) was maintained between 250 and
                 300 seconds; in group 2 (180 patients), ACT was
                 maintained between 300 and 350 seconds plus the IV
                 infusion of eptifibatide (135 microg/kg bolus + 0.5
                 microg/kg/min); and in group 3 (411 patients), ACT was
                 maintained between 350 and 400 seconds. RESULTS: Char
                 formation was detected in 69 patients of group 1, 5 of
                 group 2, and 8 of group 3. An embolic event was
                 observed in 7 patients of group 1, 3 of group 2, and 2
                 of group 3 (P = 0.01; group 1 vs group 3). Higher
                 degree of anticoagulation with heparin was associated
                 with a reduced incidence of embolic events even after
                 removing the patients undergoing ICE-guided ablation (P
                 = 0.04). CONCLUSION: More aggressive anticoagulation
                 with heparin reduced periprocedural embolic events. The
                 use of platelet inhibition does not have incremental

                 anticoagulation is considered first-line therapy in

                 Pulmonary vein isolation (PVI) with radiofrequency
                 ablation may cure AF, obviating the need for
                 antiarrhythmic drugs and anticoagulation. OBJECTIVE: To
                 determine whether PVI is feasible as first-line therapy
                 for treating patients with symptomatic AF. DESIGN,
                 SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: A multicenter prospective
                 randomized study conducted from December 31, 2001, to
                 July 1, 2002, of 70 patients aged 18 to 75 years who
                 experienced monthly symptomatic AF episodes for at
                 least 3 months and had not been treated with
                 antiarrhythmic drugs. INTERVENTION: Patients were
                 randomized to receive either PVI using radiofrequency
                 ablation (n=33) or antiarrhythmic drug treatment
                 (n=37), with a 1-year follow-up. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES:
                 Recurrence of AF, hospitalization, and quality of life
                 assessment. RESULTS: Two patients in the antiarrhythmic
                 drug treatment group and 1 patient in the PVI group
                 were lost to follow-up. At the end of 1-year follow-up,
                 22 (63\%) of 35 patients who received antiarrhythmic
                 drugs had at least 1 recurrence of symptomatic AF
                 compared with 4 (13\%) of 32 patients who received PVI
                 (P<.001). Hospitalization during 1-year follow-up
                 occurred in 19 (54\%) of 35 patients in the
                 antiarrhythmic drug group compared with 3 (9\%) of 32
                 in the PVI group (P<.001). In the antiarrhythmic drug
                 group, the mean (SD) number of AF episodes decreased
                 from 12 (7) to 6 (4), after initiating therapy (P =
                 .01). At 6-month follow-up, the improvement in quality
                 of life of patients in the PVI group was significantly
                 better than the improvement in the antiarrhythmic drug
                 group in 5 subclasses of the Short-Form 36 health
                 survey. There were no thromboembolic events in either
                 group. Asymptomatic mild or moderate pulmonary vein
                 stenosis was documented in 2 (6\%) of 32 patients in
                 the PVI group. CONCLUSION: Pulmonary vein isolation
                 appears to be a feasible first-line approach for
                 treating patients with symptomatic AF. Larger studies
                 are needed to confirm its safety and efficacy.",

                 excitation process of the heart and on body surface
                 electrocardiogram. The isotropic heart model includes
                 atria, ventricles, and a special conduction system, and
                 is electrophysiologically specified by parameters
                 relative to action potential, conduction velocity,
                 automaticity, and pacing. The anisotropic heart model
                 was created by incorporating rotating fiber directions
                 into the ventricles of the isotropic heart model. The
                 orientation of the myocardial fibers in the ventricles
                 of the model was gradually rotated counterclockwise
                 from the epicardial layer to the endocardial layer for
                 a total rotation of 90 degrees. The anisotropy of
                 conduction velocity and intracellular electric
                 conductivity was included in the simulation.
                 Comparative simulations of the normal heart, LBBB, and

                 for electrocardiographic inverse problems studies,
                 however, have usually been neglected. This paper
                 describes a procedure of simulating epicardial
                 potentials using a microcomputer-based heart-torso
                 model with realistic geometry. Our heart model
                 developed earlier is composed of approximately 65,000
                 cell units which are arranged in a cubic close-packed
                 structure. An action potential waveform with variable
                 in duration is assigned to each unit. The heart model,
                 together with the epicardial surface model constructed
                 recently, are mounted in an inhomogeneous human torso
                 model. Electric dipoles, which are proportional to the

                 in all the cell units. These dipoles give rise to a
                 potential distribution on the epicardial surface, which
                 is calculated by means of the boundary element method.
                 The simulated epicardial potential maps during a normal
                 heart beat and in a preexcited beat to mimic
                 Wolff-Parkinson-White (WPW) syndrome are in close

                 pad (AFP) maintenance on postoperative atrial
                 fibrillation (POAF) incidence. BACKGROUND: Drugs with
                 antiadrenergic effects reduce POAF. Because the
                 epicardial AFP is parasympathetically innervated, its
                 routine excision during coronary artery bypass grafting
                 (CABG) might precipitate autonomic imbalance and induce
                 POAF. METHODS: Patients (n = 180, mean age = 66 +/- 10
                 years, 80\% men, 5\% with previous atrial fibrillation)
                 undergoing CABG surgery were randomized to either AFP
                 maintenance or AFP removal. Routine prophylaxis against
                 POAF with beta-blockers (85\%) and amiodarone (28\%)
                 was allowed on the basis of caregivers' discretion. The
                 development of POAF, total hospital costs, and heart
                 rate variability was compared between groups. RESULTS:
                 Anterior fat pad maintenance did not reduce POAF
                 incidence (34.8\% vs. 35.2\%, p = 0.950) or total
                 hospital costs (data as medians with 25\%, 75\%
                 percentiles: 22,940 dollars [17,629 dollars, 29,274
                 dollars] vs. 23,866 dollars [18,602 dollars, 30,370
                 dollars], p = 0.647) but was associated with higher
                 heart rate variability (SD of normal-to-normal RR
                 intervals [SDNN]: 31.7 +/- 24.6 vs. 22.7 +/- 8.3, p =
                 0.05 and SD of all 5-min mean RR intervals [SDANN 5]:

                 removal. CONCLUSIONS: Maintaining the AFP prevents
                 attenuation of parasympathetic tone after CABG but does
                 not reduce POAF or total hospital costs in any
                 appreciable way.",

  abstract =     "afib BACKGROUND: In this study we tested the hypothesis
                 that atrial fibrillation (AF) causes
                 electrophysiological changes of the atrial myocardium
                 which might explain the progressive nature of the
                 arrhythmia. METHODS AND RESULTS: Twelve goats were
                 chronically instrumented with multiple electrodes
                 sutured to the epicardium of both atria. Two to 3 Weeks
                 after implantation, the animals were connected to a
                 fibrillation pacemaker which artificially maintained
                 AF. Whereas during control episodes of AF were short
                 lasting (6 +/- 3 seconds), artificial maintenance of AF
                 resulted in a progressive increase in the duration of
                 AF to become sustained (> 24 hours) after 7.1 +/- 4.8
                 days (10 of 11 goats). During the first 24 hours of AF
                 the median fibrillation interval shortened from 145 +/-
                 18 to 108 +/- 8 ms and the inducibility of AF by a
                 single premature stimulus increased from 24\% to 76\%.
                 The atrial effective refractory period (AERP) shortened
                 from 146 +/- 19 to 95 +/- 20 ms (-35\%) (S1S1, 400 ms).
                 At high pacing rates the shortening was less (-12\%),
                 pointing to a reversion of the normal adaptation of the
                 AERP to heart rate. In 5 goats, after 2 to 4 weeks of
                 AF, sinus rhythm was restored and all
                 electrophysiological changes were found to be
                 reversible within 1 week. CONCLUSIONS: Artificial
                 maintenance of AF leads to a marked shortening of AERP,
                 a reversion of its physiological rate adaptation, and
                 an increase in rate, inducibility and stability of AF.
                 All these changes were completely reversible within 1
                 week of sinus rhythm.",

                 prevention of recurrent atrial fibrillation (AF) despite
                 inconsistent efficacy and frequent adverse effects.
                 Catheter ablation has been proposed as an alternative
                 treatment for paroxysmal AF. OBJECTIVE: To determine the
                 efficacy of catheter ablation compared with antiarrhythmic
                 drug therapy (ADT) in treating symptomatic paroxysmal AF.
                 DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: A prospective,
                 multicenter, randomized (2:1), unblinded,
                 Bayesian-designed study conducted at 19 hospitals of 167
                 patients who did not respond to at least 1 antiarrhythmic
                 drug and who experienced at least 3 AF episodes within 6
                 months before randomization. Enrollment occurred between
                 October 25, 2004, and October 11, 2007, with the last
                 follow-up on January 19, 2009. INTERVENTION: Catheter
                 ablation (n = 106) or ADT (n = 61), with assessment for
                 effectiveness in a comparable 9-month follow-up period.
                 MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Time to protocol-defined treatment
                 failure. The proportion of patients who experienced major
                 treatment-related adverse events within 30 days of
                 catheter ablation or ADT was also reported. RESULTS: At
                 the end of the 9-month effectiveness evaluation period,
                 66\% of patients in the catheter ablation group remained
                 free from protocol-defined treatment failure compared with
                 16\% of patients treated with ADT. The hazard ratio of
                 catheter ablation to ADT was 0.30 (95\% confidence
                 interval, 0.19-0.47; P < .001). Major 30-day
                 treatment-related adverse events occurred in 5 of 57
                 patients (8.8\%) treated with ADT and 5 of 103 patients
                 (4.9\%) treated with catheter ablation. Mean quality of
                 life scores improved significantly in patients treated by
                 catheter ablation compared with ADT at 3 months;
                 improvement was maintained during the course of the study.
                 CONCLUSION: Among patients with paroxysmal AF who had not
                 responded to at least 1 antiarrhythmic drug, the use of
                 catheter ablation compared with ADT resulted in a longer
                 time to treatment failure during the 9-month follow-up
                 period. TRIAL REGISTRATION: clinicaltrials.gov Identifier:

                 was to see if there was a variation and how big it was,
                 to see if the index was relatively robust over time. It
                 was supposed to indicate myocardium at risk and so if
                 it is worth anything, the index should not change much
                 with time. Time between ECGs ranged from 9--113 minutes
                 and they found that in 68\% of patients, there was no
                 change in scores. But for the rest the change suggested
                 the need for a stable period to use the system, and to
                 find a stable period, you need to record continuously,
                 which is the take-home message. I will have to check
                 the reference on the scoring scheme to see if it makes
                 sense or could be converted to BSPM data.",

                 Circ Res. 1999;84:562-570), O'Rourke et al show that
                 Ca2+ transients recorded in myocytes isolated from
                 canine hearts subjected to the tachycardia pacing
                 protocol exhibit similar responses. Analyses of protein
                 levels in these failing hearts reveal that both SR Ca2+
                 ATPase and phospholamban are decreased on average by
                 28\% and that Na+/Ca2+ exchanger (NCX) protein is
                 increased on average by 104\%. In this article, we
                 present a model of the canine midmyocardial ventricular
                 action potential and Ca2+ transient. The model is used
                 to estimate the degree of functional upregulation and
                 downregulation of NCX and SR Ca2+ ATPase in heart
                 failure using data obtained from 2 different
                 experimental protocols. Model estimates of average SR
                 Ca2+ ATPase functional downregulation obtained using
                 these experimental protocols are 49\% and 62\%. Model
                 estimates of average NCX functional upregulation range
                 are 38\% and 75\%. Simulation of voltage-clamp Ca2+
                 transients indicates that such changes are sufficient
                 to account for the reduced amplitude, altered shape,
                 and slowed relaxation of Ca2+ transients in the failing
                 canine heart. Model analyses also suggest that altered
                 expression of Ca2+ handling proteins plays a
                 significant role in prolongation of action potential
                 duration in failing canine myocytes.",

                 pharmacological agents. 3. A growing number of drugs
                 associated with QT prolongation and its concomitant
                 risks of arrhythmia and sudden death have been shown to

                 the industrialized world, with the majority of such
                 tragedies being due to ventricular fibrillation.
                 Ventricular fibrillation is a frenzied and irregular
                 disturbance of the heart rhythm that quickly renders
                 the heart incapable of sustaining life. Rotors,
                 electrophysiological structures that emit rotating
                 spiral waves, occur in several systems that all share
                 with the heart the functional properties of
                 excitability and refractoriness. These re-entrant
                 waves, seen in numerical solutions of simplified models
                 of cardiac tissue, may occur during ventricular
                 tachycardias. It has been difficult to detect such
                 forms of re-entry in fibrillating mammalian ventricles.
                 Here we show that, in isolated perfused dog hearts,
                 high spatial and temporal resolution mapping of optical
                 transmembrane potentials can easily detect transiently
                 erupting rotors during the early phase of ventricular
                 fibrillation. This activity is characterized by a
                 relatively high spatiotemporal cross-correlation.
                 During this early fibrillatory interval, frequent
                 wavefront collisions and wavebreak generation are also
                 dominant features. Interestingly, this spatiotemporal
                 pattern undergoes an evolution to a less highly
                 spatially correlated mechanism that lacks the
                 epicardial manifestations of rotors despite continued
                 myocardial perfusion.",

                 resonance frequency shift of the methoxy group of the
                 praseodymium complex (Pr probe). The respective pulse
                 sequences employed to detect temperature-dependent
                 signal changes were the multiple readout single
                 inversion recovery (T One by Multiple Read Out Pulses;
                 TOMROP), the pulsed gradient spin echo (PGSE), the fast
                 low-angle shot (FLASH) with phase difference
                 reconstruction, and the classical chemical shift
                 imaging (CSI). Applying these sequences, experiments
                 were performed in two separate and consecutive steps.
                 In the first step, calibration curves were recorded for
                 all four methods. In the second step, applying these
                 calibration data, maps of temperature changes were
                 generated and verified. With the equal total
                 acquisition time of approximately 4 min for all four
                 methods, the uncertainties of temperature changes
                 derived from the calibration curves were less than 1
                 degree C (Pr probe 0.11 degrees C, water PRF 0.22
                 degrees C, D 0.48 degrees C and T1 0.93 degrees C). The
                 corresponding maps of temperature changes exhibited
                 slightly higher errors but still in the range or less
                 than 1 degree C (0.97 degrees C, 0.41 degrees C, 0.70
                 degrees C, 1.06 degrees C respectively). The
                 calibration results indicate the Pr probe method to be
                 most sensitive and accurate. However, this advantage
                 could only be partially transferred to the
                 thermographic maps because of the coarse 16 x 16 matrix
                 of the classical CSI sequence. Therefore, at present
                 the water PRF method appears to be most suitable for MR
                 monitoring of small temperature changes during
                 hyperthermia treatment.",

                  incidence was examined in 5,070 participants in the
                  Framingham Study after 34 years of follow-up. Compared with
                  subjects free of these conditions, the age-adjusted incidence
                  of stroke was more than doubled in the presence of coronary
                  heart disease (p less than 0.001) and more than trebled in
                  the presence of hypertension (p less than 0.001). There was a
                  more than fourfold excess of stroke in subjects with cardiac
                  failure (p less than 0.001) and a near fivefold excess when
                  atrial fibrillation was present (p less than 0.001). In
                  persons with coronary heart disease or cardiac failure,
                  atrial fibrillation doubled the stroke risk in men and
                  trebled the risk in women. With increasing age the effects of
                  hypertension, coronary heart disease, and cardiac failure on
                  the risk of stroke became progressively weaker (p less than
                  0.05). Advancing age, however, did not reduce the significant
                  impact of atrial fibrillation. For persons aged 80-89 years,
                  atrial fibrillation was the sole cardiovascular condition to
                  exert an independent effect on stroke incidence (p less than
                  0.001). The attributable risk of stroke for all
                  cardiovascular contributors decreased with age except for
                  atrial fibrillation, for which the attributable risk
                  increased significantly (p less than 0.01), rising from 
                  1.5\% for those aged 50--59 years to 23.5\% for those aged 
                  80--89 years. While these findings highlight the impact of 
                  each cardiovascular condition on the risk of stroke, the 
                  data suggest that the elderly are particularly vulnerable 
                  to stroke when atrial fibrillation is present."

                 involves extensive radiofrequency ablation (RFA) of the
                 left atrium (LA) around the pulmonary veins. The effect of
                 this therapy on LA function is not fully characterized.
                 OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to determine
                 whether catheter ablation of AF is associated with a
                 change in LA function. METHODS: LA and right atrial (RA)
                 systolic function was assessed in 33 consecutive patients
                 with paroxysmal or persistent AF referred for ablation
                 using cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging.
                 Steady-state free precession ECG cine CMR imaging was
                 performed before and after (mean 48 days) AF ablation. All
                 patients underwent circumferential pulmonary vein
                 isolation using an 8-mm tip RFA catheter. High spatial
                 resolution late gadolinium enhancement CMR images of LA
                 scar were obtained in 16 patients. RESULTS: Maximum LA
                 volume decreased by 15\% (P <.001), and LA ejection
                 fraction decreased by 14\% (P <.001) after AF ablation.
                 Maximum RA volume decreased by 13\% (P = .018), but RA
                 ejection fraction increased by 5\% (P = .008). Mean LA
                 scar volume was 8.1 +/- 3.7 mL. A linear correlation was
                 observed between change in LA ejection fraction and scar
                 volume (r = -0.75, P <.001). CONCLUSION: Catheter ablation
                 of AF is associated with decreased LA size and reduced
                 atrial systolic function. This change strongly correlates
                 with the volume of LA scar. This finding may have
                 implications for postprocedural thromboembolic risk and
                 for procedures involving more extensive RFA.",

                 mechanical activation in the left ventricle (LV) while
                 seven canine hearts were paced in situ from three
                 different sites: the base of the LV free wall (LVb),
                 the right ventricular apex (RVa), and the right atrium
                 (RA). Strain maps plotted against time showed the
                 evolution of shortening over the entire LV midwall and
                 were used to generate mechanical activation maps
                 showing the onset of circumferential shortening. RA
                 pacing showed rapid synchronous shortening; LVb pacing
                 showed a wave front of mechanical activation
                 propagating slowly and steadily from the pacing site,

                 activation of the LV was 63.1 +/- 24.3 ms for RA
                 pacing, 130.2 +/- 9.8 ms for LVb pacing, and 121.3 +/-
                 17.9 ms for RVa pacing. The velocity of mechanical
                 activation was calculated for LVb and RVa pacing and

  abstract =     "BACKGROUND: There are two approaches to the treatment
                 of atrial fibrillation: one is cardioversion and
                 treatment with antiarrhythmic drugs to maintain sinus
                 rhythm, and the other is the use of rate-controlling
                 drugs, allowing atrial fibrillation to persist. In both
                 approaches, the use of anticoagulant drugs is
                 recommended. METHODS: We conducted a randomized,
                 multicenter comparison of these two treatment
                 strategies in patients with atrial fibrillation and a
                 high risk of stroke or death. The primary end point was
                 overall mortality. RESULTS: A total of 4060 patients
                 (mean [+/-SD] age, 69.7+/-9.0 years) were enrolled in
                 the study; 70.8 percent had a history of hypertension,
                 and 38.2 percent had coronary artery disease. Of the
                 3311 patients with echocardiograms, the left atrium was
                 enlarged in 64.7 percent and left ventricular function
                 was depressed in 26.0 percent. There were 356 deaths
                 among the patients assigned to rhythm-control therapy
                 and 310 deaths among those assigned to rate-control
                 therapy (mortality at five years, 23.8 percent and 21.3
                 percent, respectively; hazard ratio, 1.15 [95 percent
                 confidence interval, 0.99 to 1.34]; P=0.08). More
                 patients in the rhythm-control group than in the
                 rate-control group were hospitalized, and there were
                 more adverse drug effects in the rhythm-control group
                 as well. In both groups, the majority of strokes
                 occurred after warfarin had been stopped or when the
                 international normalized ratio was subtherapeutic.
                 CONCLUSIONS: Management of atrial fibrillation with the
                 rhythm-control strategy offers no survival advantage
                 over the rate-control strategy, and there are potential
                 advantages, such as a lower risk of adverse drug
                 effects, with the rate-control strategy.

                 distributions on the body surface of the patients and

                 the prognostic value of novel T-wave morphology
                 descriptors derived from resting 12-lead ECGs. METHODS
                 AND RESULTS: In 280 consecutive post-MI patients, a
                 12-lead ECG was recorded before discharge, optically
                 scanned, and digitized. For the present study, 5 T-wave
                 morphology descriptors were automatically calculated
                 after singular value decomposition of the ECG signal.
                 The total cosine R-to-T (TCRT [describes the global
                 angle between repolarization and depolarization
                 wavefront]) and the T-wave loop dispersion were
                 univariately associated (P:=0.0002 and P:<0.002,
                 respectively, U: test) with 27 prospectively defined
                 clinical events in 261 patients (mean follow-up 32+/-10
                 months). Kaplan-Meier event probability curves for
                 strata above and below the median confirmed the strong
                 risk discrimination by TCRT and T-wave loop dispersion
                 (P:<0.003 and P:<0.001, respectively, log-rank test).
                 On Cox regression analysis, with the entering of age,
                 left ventricular ejection fraction, heart rate, QRS
                 width, reperfusion therapy, beta-adrenergic-blocker
                 treatment, and standard deviation of R-R intervals on
                 24-hour Holter monitoring, TCRT (P:<0.03) yielded
                 independent predictive value, whereas T-wave loop
                 dispersion was of borderline independence (P:=0.064).
                 Heart rate (P:<0.02), left ventricular ejection
                 fraction (P:<0.02), and reperfusion therapy (P:<0.02)
                 also remained in the final model. CONCLUSIONS:
                 Computerized T-wave morphology analysis of the 12-lead
                 resting ECG permits independent assessment of post-MI
                 risk and an improved risk stratification when combined
                 with other risk markers.",

                 myocardial borders and manual classification of scar
                 tissue. In this paper, we propose an novel,
                 semi-automatic approach to segment the left ventricular
                 wall and classify scar tissue using a combination of
                 modern image processing techniques. We obtained
                 high-resolution magnetic resonance angiograms (MRA) and
                 late-gadolinium enhanced magnetic resonance imaging
                 (LGE-MRI) in 14 patients who had ventricular scar from
                 a prior myocardial infarction. We applied (1) a level
                 set-based segmentation approach using a combination of
                 the MRA and LGE-MRI to segment the myocardium and then
                 (2) an automated signal intensity algorithm (Otsu
                 thresholding) to identify ventricular scar tissue. We
                 compared results from both steps to those of expert
                 observers. The LV geometry using the semi-automated
                 segmentation method had a mean overlap of 94\% with the
                 manual segmentations. The scar volumes obtained with
                 the Otsu method correlated with the expert observer
                 scar volumes (Dice comparison coefficient of 0.85±
                 0.11). This proof of concept segmentation pipeline

                 arrhythmogenic cardiac disorder, associated with an
                 increased incidence of sudden death. Its arrhythmogenic
                 substrate in the intact human heart remains ill-defined.
                 METHODS AND RESULTS: -Using noninvasive ECG imaging
                 (ECGI), we studied 25 BrS patients to characterize the
                 electrophysiologic substrate, and 6 patients with right
                 bundle branch block (RBBB) for comparison. Seven normal
                 subjects provided control data. Abnormal substrate was
                 observed exclusively in the right ventricular outflow
                 tract (RVOT) with the following properties (compared to
                 normal controls; p<0.005): (1)ST-segment elevation (STE)
                 and inverted T-wave of unipolar electrograms (EGMs)
                 (2.21+/-0.67 vs. 0 mV); (2)delayed RVOT activation
                 (82+/-18 vs. 37+/-11 ms); (3)low amplitude (0.47+/-0.16
                 vs. 3.74+/-1.60 mV) and fractionated EGMs, suggesting slow
                 discontinuous conduction; (4)prolonged recovery time (RT;
                 381+/-30 vs. 311+/-34 ms) and activation-recovery
                 intervals (ARIs; 318+/-32 vs. 241+/-27 ms), indicating
                 delayed repolarization; (5)steep repolarization gradients
                 (DeltaRT/Deltax= 96+/-28 vs. 7+/-6 ms/cm, DeltaARI/Deltax=
                 105+/-24 vs. 7+/-5 ms/cm) at RVOT borders. With increased
                 heart rate in 6 BrS patients, reduced STE and increased
                 fractionation were observed. Unlike BrS, RBBB had delayed
                 activation in the entire RV, without STE, fractionation,
                 or repolarization abnormalities on EGMs. CONCLUSIONS: -The
                 results indicate that both, slow discontinuous conduction
                 and steep dispersion of repolarization are present in the
                 RVOT of BrS patients. ECGI could differentiate between BrS
                 and RBBB.",

                 excitation wave over the atria following initiation in a
                 given focus in an atrial model containing its overall
                 geometry only, i.e., without atrial bundles. METHODS AND
                 RESULTS: The propagation velocity of the excitation wave
                 was taken to be uniform, and the wall thickness was
                 discarded. The timing of excitation of any point on the
                 atrium thus becomes directly proportional to its shortest
                 distance over the atrial wall to the focus. Despite these
                 gross simplifications, the general nature of the
                 excitation sequence found corresponded closely to clinical
                 data reported in the literature. This suggests that the
                 complex overall geometry of the atria dominates the timing
                 of the excitation. A highly intriguing observation from
                 this study was that, when looking at the pathways from the
                 sinus node to all other points on the atrium, prominent
                 routes became visible even though no such pathways formed
                 part of the model of the atrial geometry used. The
                 locations of these prominent routes coincide with those of
                 various distinct bundles in the atria. Possible inferences
                 of these observations are discussed. CONCLUSION: Based
                 upon comparison with data from other studies, it is
                 concluded that, during stable heart rhythms, propagation
                 of the atrial excitation wave is well approximated by an
                 assumption of uniform velocity, even though no atrial
                 bundles were included in the model. The overall geometry
                 seems to be the dominant factor in the spread of
                 excitation.",

                 conductivity of different tissues, such as blood and lung
                 tissue, on the body surface potentials generated by atrial
                 electrical activity. METHODS: A 64-lead ECG from a healthy
                 subject was recorded. The subject's geometries of torso,
                 lungs, heart, and blood cavities were derived by magnetic
                 resonance imaging. These geometries were used to construct
                 a numerical volume conductor model. The boundary element
                 method was applied to simulate the potentials on the
                 surface of the thorax generated by the atria. The
                 equivalent double layer served as the source description
                 during depolarization. Recorded body surface potentials
                 were used as a check on the simulations. Subsequently, the
                 conductivities in the model were varied to determine their
                 influence on P wave morphology and amplitude. RESULTS: The
                 model with realistic conductivity values for blood and
                 lungs produced potentials that closely matched the
                 measured ones (correlation 98\%). The subsequent variation
                 of conductivity of blood and lungs revealed a major
                 influence on P wave morphology and amplitude: a mean
                 reduction in amplitude by 42\%, with pronounced inter-lead
                 differences. CONCLUSION: The inhomogeneities of lungs and
                 atrial blood cavities need to be incorporated in volume
                 conductor models linking atrial electric activity to body
                 surface potentials.",

                 relationship between the Elg and the surface

                 model-based study aimed at investigating the differences

                 well as the effect of the insulating boundary of the ILR
                 on these signals. Additionally, the model is used for
                 determining the optimal implant location of the device.
                 METHODS AND RESULTS: Sinus rhythm ECG of a complete heart
                 cycle was simulated by means of a biophysical model.
                 Different volume conductors were created to investigate
                 the effect of the insulating boundary of the ILR. The Elg

                 The differences between the bipolar ECG on the surface and
                 the subcutaneous electrogram are negligible. The optimal
                 implant location may be based on nearby surface

                 on the myocardial surface serving as the equivalent source
                 of cardiac activity, with local transmembrane potentials
                 (TMP) acting as their strength. The TMP wave forms were
                 described analytically by timing parameters, found by
                 minimizing the difference between observed body surface
                 potentials and those based on the source description. The
                 parameter estimation procedure involved is non-linear, and
                 consequently requires the specification of initial
                 estimates of its solution. Those of the timing of
                 depolarization were based on the fastest route algorithm,
                 taking into account properties of anisotropic propagation
