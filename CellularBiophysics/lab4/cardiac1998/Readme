Ingemar Jacobson contributed this model with the comment
"...  Following
compilation the model can be launched from the startatrial1.hoc file -
you then just need to start the simulation - I suggest with the
variable time step ticked. I had some problems with the intracellular
Ca2+-dynamics and for = clarity I had to split it into several files -
now it works reasonably well also for CVODE.  Having defined the model
files of the various cardiac currents it is an easy task to convert
the atrial model to more or less any other cardiac cell type. 
Hopefully this will be of some use for cardiac electrophysiogists.

and also
"...
 Perhaps some of the model files can serve as templates for neuronal
channels- the molecular correlate for the cardiac Ito is Kv4.3, for IKur
it is Kv1.5; for IKr - it is HERG, all these being potassium channels
you will find in the CNS.

Questions about the model should be directed to the original authors.
Questions about the computer implementation should be directed to
Dr. Jacobson. Questions about the database presentation should be
directed to Michael Hines. Following is a slightly expanded copy of
the "about" screen that pops up when the model is executed.
Running the model via the mosinit.hoc file (executed automatically by the
autolaunch process) will generate the heart action potential
shown in the ap.gif file.

The model is based on the paper by

Marc Courtemanche, Rafael J. Ramirez, and Stanley Nattel.
Ionic mechanisms underlying human atrial action potential properties
insights from a mathematical model 
Am J Physiol Heart Circ Physiol 1998 275: H301-H321.

and conductance values are adjusted to give appropriate current
densities.  Pumps, exchangers and an additional electroneutral ion
accumulation mechanism are sat so that ion concentrations are stable at
a pacing rate of 1 Hz. 

The kinetics of IKur is modified to fit data of
 Feng et al Am J Physiol 1998 275(Heart Circ Physiol 44):H1717-H1725.

The possibility to include a nonspecific cation-current with kinetics
similar to IKur is also given in the IKur mechanism For the
intracellular Ca dynamics to work the mechanisms Cadynam, ca_jsr,
Ca_jsracc and ca_nsracc have to be inserted.  For simulation of
intracellular Na+-ion and K+-ion changes the mechanisms Na_acc and K_acc
have to be inserted.  The model is free to use provided acknowledgement
is given to the developers of NEURON
