\section{Q1}
When looking at Figure | we see the square with an equalateral triangle drawn in. The Sides of the square are 256, and the sides of the triangle are 160. The angle at each of the Vertices is A (60\degrees) and the distance from the centroid to the verticies is R. If we construct a sub triangle by making the line h from the centroid to the bottom side and using R we find a new angle B. This angle (B) is half of A (30\degrees).To find the location of the vertex V
