                 monophasic action potential (MAP) at an ischemic border
                 zone to serious ventricular arrhythmia (VA).
                 Measurements were made in 36 adult mongrel dogs 15
                 minutes after occlusion of the left anterior descending
                 coronary artery. We recorded MAPs and bipolar
                 electrograms simultaneously inside and outside the
                 ischemic border zone in the dog hearts. Of the 36 dogs,
                 24 that had favorable MAP recordings were chosen and
                 were divided into two groups according to an occurrence
                 of VA. In group A (n = 12), an onset time of VA was 5.1
                 +/- 0.8 minutes after ischemia, while in group B (n =
                 12) VA did not occur during ischemia. The conduction
                 delay at the ischemic border zone was significantly
                 greater from 3 minutes after ischemia in group A than
                 in group B. MAP alternans, defined as the difference in
                 duration of two consecutive MAPs inside the ischemic
                 border, was marked in group A but mild in group B.
                 Duration of a small MAP of alternans was markedly
                 shorter than that of a corresponding MAP outside the
                 ischemic border in both groups, but was followed by VA
                 in group A. Duration of a large MAP was markedly
                 prolonged compared with that of a corresponding MAP
                 outside the ischemic border in seven dogs of group A
                 and in only one dog of group B (p less than 0.01), and
                 was followed by VA in seven dogs of group A. Our
                 results suggest that the mechanism of VA is due not
                 only to reentry but also to an injury current flowing
                 from ischemic to nonischemic tissues, because VA was
                 preceded by conduction delay and by a difference in MAP
                 durations when comparing regions inside and outside the
                 ischemic border.",

                 electrocardiograms for clinical decision making is that
                 the waveforms are influenced by normal physiological
                 and technical factors as well as by pathophysiological
                 factors. Traditionally, the focus of bedside monitoring
                 is detection of arrhythmia. However, continuous

                 leadership role for clinical nurse specialists and
                 nurse practitioners is to become knowledgeable about
                 interpretation of 12-lead electrocardiograms and to
                 share this knowledge with staff nurses who care for
                 patients with acute coronary syndromes. The factors

                 Of the 40 subjects, 6 (4 car- diac, 2 healthy)
                 developed positional ST deviations of 1 mm or more on

                 same six subjects showed ST- segment deviation of which
                 most occurred in the left-lying position. Positional ST
                 changes were most frequent for males and for cardiac
                 patients (33\%). Changes in QRS complex morphology were

                 translates into functional electrical instability
                 leading to torsade de pointes (TdP) in LQTS are poorly
                 understood.METHODS AND RESULTS:The cellular basis of
                 TdP was investigated using a novel approach of
                 transmural optical imaging in the canine wedge
                 preparation (n=14). The spatial organization of
                 repolarization and arrhythmogenesis were determined in
                 a surrogate model of LQT2. Action potentials were
                 recorded simultaneously from 128 sites spanning the
                 transmural wall of the left ventricle. In LQT2, QT
                 interval prolongation was paralleled by an abrupt rise
                 in transmural dispersion of repolarization (DOR) from
                 2.7 plus/minus 0.9 ms/mm (controls) to 12.2 plus/minus
                 2.1 ms/mm (LQT2). Islands of midmyocardial (M) cells
                 formed zones of increased refractoriness in LQT2,
                 producing steep spatial gradients of repolarization
                 that were directly responsible for conduction block and
                 self-sustained intramural reentrant circuits underlying
                 TdP.CONCLUSIONS:These data provide direct evidence
                 supporting the functional expression of M cells in
                 intact myocardium and a central role for M cells in the
                 development of reentrant TdP arrhythmias in LQTS.",

                 TIA, and to determine potential predictors of PAF to
                 allow more focused testing.METHODS:We reviewed records
                 of 1128 consecutive patients attending a university
                 stroke clinic from September 2005 to September 2006 and
                 identified 426 patients with definite TIA or stroke. We
                 abstracted clinical, cardiac imaging, and neuroimaging
                 data. Logistic regression analysis was performed to
                 determine independent predictors of PAF on Holter
                 monitor.RESULTS:Overall, 413 of 426 patients (65 Â± 15
                 years; male, 49.8\%) with a definite TIA (53\%) or
                 stroke (47\%) underwent Holter monitoring for a mean of
                 22.6 hours. PAF occurred in 39 patients (9.2\%) all
                 older than age 55 years. PAF lasting &gt; 30 seconds
                 was evident in 11 patients (2.5\%). The other 28
                 patients had PAF &lt; 30 seconds (6.5\%). In

                 1.9-17.8; P = 0.0023) were associated with
                 PAF.CONCLUSIONS:PAF is present in 9.2\% of patients
                 with definite stroke or TIA. Age older than 55 years
                 and presence of acute or chronic brain infarcts on

  abstract =     "BACKGROUND:Recent studies have proposed to include
                 both ST depression and ST elevation in the diagnosis of
                 myocardial ischemia, hence, considering all ST
                 deviations relevant. In this study, we examined to
                 which extent an ST dipole model accounts for the
                 measured ST deviations in acute ischemia patients using
                 2 different sets of lead vectors.METHODS:12-Lead
                 electrocardiograms (ECGs) were recorded from 45
                 patients with occlusive single-vessel disease with
                 thrombolysis in myocardial infarction (TIMI) flow 0/1
                 (15 anterior descending artery, 15 right coronary
                 artery, 15 left circumflex artery), and ST deviations
                 were measured in the J point in all leads. The dipole
                 model was established by considering ST deviations as
                 projections of a single dipole onto a set of lead
                 vectors. A set of simplified unit length lead vectors
                 and a set of lead vectors from the Dower transformation
                 were compared. For each ECG and model, the best-fitting
                 dipole was estimated by minimizing the sum of squared
                 errors between measured and projected ST deviations
                 across all leads.RESULTS:The goodness-of-fit metric
                 (R(2)) for all recordings showed strong agreement
                 between measured and projected ST deviations for both
                 dipole models with R(2) of 0.77 to 0.83 (95\%
                 confidence interval [CI]) for the simplified model and
                 R(2) of 0.91 to 0.93 (95\% CI) for the Dower-based
                 model. The Dower-based model showed superior
                 performance for the whole population and for each of
                 the occlusion artery subgroups (P &lt; .05), but only
                 small differences were seen between the estimated ST
                 dipoles from the 2 models.CONCLUSION:A simple dipole
                 model may be a useful descriptor of ST-segment
                 deviations, reducing ST deviation measurements from 12
                 leads to a single 3-dimensional vector.",

                 potential to detect the earliest phases of acute

  abstract =     "INTRODUCTION:
Myocardial ischemia is a pathological condition initiated by supply and demand imbalance of the blood to the heart. Previous studies suggest that ischemia originates in the subendocardium, i.e., that nontransmural ischemia is limited to the subendocardium. By contrast, we hypothesized that acute myocardial ischemia is not limited to the subendocardium and sought to document its spatial distribution in an animal preparation. The goal of these experiments was to investigate the spatial organization of ischemia and its relationship to the resulting shifts in ST segment potentials during short episodes of acute ischemia.
METHODS:
We conducted acute ischemia studies in open-chest canines (N=19) and swines (N=10), which entailed creating carefully controlled ischemia using demand, supply or complete occlusion ischemia protocols and recording intramyocardial and epicardial potentials. Elevation of the potentials at 40\% of the ST segment between the J-point and the peak of the T-wave (ST40\%) provided the metric for local ischemia. The threshold for ischemic ST segment elevations was defined as two standard deviations away from the baseline values.
RESULTS:
The relative frequency of occurrence of acute ischemia was higher in the subendocardium (78\% for canines and 94\% for swines) and the mid-wall (87\% for canines and 97\% for swines) in comparison with the subepicardium (30\% for canines and 22\% for swines). In addition, acute ischemia was seen arising throughout the myocardium (distributed pattern) in 87\% of the canine and 94\% of the swine episodes. Alternately, acute ischemia was seen originating only in the subendocardium (subendocardial pattern) in 13\% of the canine episodes and 6\% of the swine episodes (p<0.05).
CONCLUSIONS:
Our findings suggest that the spatial distribution of acute ischemia is a complex phenomenon arising throughout the myocardial wall and is not limited to the subendocardium.",

                 patients who will have no benefit from reperfusion
                 because of either late arrival or nonischemic

                 An intramural electrically inactive area encircled by a
                 transmural area with slowed impulse propagation

                 these waves depend on the spatial arrangement of
                 ventricular myocytes, termed fiber orientation. In
                 computational studies simulating electrical wave
                 propagation or mechanical contraction in the heart,
                 accurately representing fiber orientation is critical
                 so that model predictions corroborate with experimental
                 data. Typically, fiber orientation is assigned to heart
                 models based on Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI) data,
                 yet few alternative methodologies exist if DTI data is

                 of potassium can induce abnormalities in both impulse
                 conduction and impulse generation. Inhomogeneities of
                 potassium conductance will elicit regional differences
                 in action potential duration and repolarisation. The
                 resulting spatial dispersion of refractory period will
                 allow for fragmentation of impulse conduction on
                 ensuing beats, the formation of irregular reentrant
                 pathways and ventricular fibrillation. In a similar
                 manner, the spread of injury current from the ischaemic
                 tissue to surrounding normal tissue can trigger
                 extrasystoles (depolarisation induced automaticity). It
                 has been hypothesised that the activation of the ATP
                 sensitive potassium channel contributes significantly
                 to reductions in action potential duration and
                 increases in extracellular potassium accumulation
                 during myocardial ischaemia. ATP sensitive potassium
                 channel antagonists prevent ischaemically induced
                 reductions in action potential duration and the
                 dispersion of refractory period but may induce
                 oscillatory afterpotentials under some conditions (for
                 example, calcium overload). In contrast, potassium
                 channel agonists enhance the dispersion of refractory
                 period ischaemia, which promotes the formation of
                 re-entrant arrhythmias. The pharmacological modulation
                 of the ATP sensitive potassium channels could therefore
                 offer a novel approach for the management of cardiac
                 arrhythmias in patients with ischaemic heart disease.
                 In general, channel antagonists prevent ventricular
                 fibrillation, while high (hypotensive) doses of channel
                 agonists can induce malignant arrhythmias during
                 ischaemia in animal models. However, recent evidence
                 also suggests that potassium channel agonists may
                 promote a better preservation of myocardial mechanical
                 performance during reperfusion while ATP sensitive
                 potassium channel antagonists exacerbate mechanical
                 depression during ischaemia in experimental

                 Three releasable materials were tested: gel foam, wax
                 microspheres (120-200 micron) and latex balloons, using
                 different methods of introduction. The left carotid

                 of cardiac growth and remodeling (G&amp;R) experimental
                 studies need to be complemented by mathematical models.
                 This paper reviews models for cardiac growth and
                 remodeling of myofiber orientation, as induced by
                 mechanical stimuli. A distinction is made between
                 optimization models, that focus on the end stage of
                 G&amp;R, and adaptation models, that aim to more
                 closely describe the mechanistic relation between
                 stimulus and effect. While many models demonstrate
                 qualitatively promising results, a lot of questions
                 remain, e.g. with respect to the choice of the stimulus
                 for G&amp;R or the long-term stability of the outcome

                 and testing of hypotheses on stimulus-effect relations
                 in mathematical models is needed to answer these
                 questions on cardiac G&amp;R. Ultimately, models of
                 cardiac G&amp;R seem indispensable for patient-specific
                 modeling, both to reconstruct the actual state of the

                 myocardial tissue, and the dependency of active muscle
                 fiber stress on time, strain, and strain rate. Ischemia
                 was modeled by disabling the generation of active
                 stress in a region comprising approximately 12\% of
                 total wall volume. In the model simulations, the
                 approximately 12\% reduction in the amount of normally
                 contracting tissue resulted in an approximately 25\%
                 reduction in stroke work compared with the normal

                 asymmetric with respect to the ischemic region because
                 of the anisotropy of the myocardial tissue. Epicardial
                 fiber shortening in and around the ischemic region, as

                 torso model. This torso model contains descriptions of
                 the epicardium, lungs, skeletal muscle (with a
                 continuously varying fiber field) and subcutaneous fat.
                 The number of nodes, elements and solution
                 degrees-of-freedom used in the computational torso

                 the absence of known coronary artery disease, ST-T
                 changes suggestive of silent ischemia on the admission
                 electrocardiogram (ECG) identify a group of patients at
                 high risk for cardiac event or death. A prospective
                 cohort study was undertaken at the university hospital
                 of a tertiary care center. All patients admitted to the
                 hospital during the 5-month study period were screened.
                 The authors found 54 patients with risk factors but no
                 symptoms of coronary artery disease whose admission
                 ECGs showed silent ischemia (ischemia group), and 71
                 patients with similar risk of coronary artery disease
                 but without admission ECGs showing silent ischemia
                 (control group). Three-week and 6-month incidences of
                 angina, myocardial infarction, and death among patients
                 in the silent ischemia and control groups were
                 compared. Seven (13\%) patients in the silent ischemia
                 group had cardiac events or noncardiac death in the
                 subsequent 3 weeks versus one (1\%) noncardiac death in
                 the control group (p &lt; 0.02). At 6 months, eight
                 (15\%) patients in the silent ischemia group versus two
                 (3\%) in the control group had cardiac events (p =
                 0.02). It is concluded that among patients with risk
                 factors but no symptoms of coronary artery disease,
                 silent ischemia on the admission ECG is associated with
                 an increased likelihood of short-term death or cardiac
                 event.",

                 attributed to injury current, delayed ventricular
                 depolarization and early repolarization, tissue anoxia,
                 and acidosis. To our knowledge, no studies have
                 addressed the appearance of the J wave in relation to
                 the myocardial K+ transfer and metabolism during
                 hypothermia. Dogs (n = 9) were progressively cooled,
                 blood samples were taken from the aorta and coronary
                 sinus, and myocardial tissue samples were obtained for
                 adenosine triphosphate (ATP), creatine phosphate (CP),
                 and glycolytic intermediate determination. In every
                 instance, the appearance of the J wave was preceded by
                 a net loss of K+ from the myocardium. In one dog, there
                 was no myocardial K+ loss and the J wave was absent.
                 The J wave appeared when the esophageal temperature was
                 between 27 degrees and 24 degrees C (26.6 +/- 0.73
                 degrees C). At that temperature, the animals were
                 hypotensive and bradycardic, but arterial oxygen
                 partial pressure, carbon dioxide partial pressure, and
                 pH were within the physiologic range at that
                 temperature. The myocardial ATP and CP from the
                 hypothermic dogs was lower compared with the value
                 obtained from dogs at 37 degrees C (p &lt; .025 and p
                 &lt; .005, respectively). The levels of the glycolytic
                 intermediates, fructose-1,6-diphosphate,
                 dihydroxyacetone phosphate, and pyruvate, were lower
                 and the level of lactate was higher compared with those
                 from the normothermic dogs (not significant; p &lt;
                 .007, p &lt; .02, p &lt; .001, respectively). These
                 findings suggest that the appearance of the J wave on
                 electrocardiography during cooling is a result of
                 depression of the metabolic process concerned with
                 maintenance of the partition of ions across the cell
                 membrane, as evidenced by decreased myocardial energy
                 content and K+ loss during the hypothermic state.",

                 validity of the traditional two step, equivalent
                 cardiac source approach to modeling the forward problem
                 of electrocardiology as the equivalent source
                 calculation occurs in what is effectively an isolated
                 cardiac region. In the physical situation the heart is

                 (CART) technique for detecting spontaneous termination
                 or sustenance of AF with sparse
                 data.METHOD:Electrocardiogram (ECG) recordings were
                 obtained from the PhysioNet (AF Termination Challenge
                 Database 2004) Web site. Signal analysis, feature
                 extraction, and classification were made to distinguish
                 among 3 AF episodes, namely, Nonterminating (N), Soon
                 (&lt;1 minute) to be terminating (S), and Terminating
                 immediately (&lt;1 second) (T).RESULTS:A continuous
                 wavelet transform whose basis functions match the EKG
                 patterns was found to yield compact representation
                 (approximately 2 orders of magnitude). This facilitates
                 the development of efficient algorithms for beat
                 detection, QRST subtraction, and multiple ECG
                 quantifier extraction (eg, QRS width, QT interval). A
                 compact feature set was extracted through principal
                 component analysis of these quantifiers. Accuracies
                 exceeding 90\% for AF episode classification were
                 achieved.CONCLUSIONS:A wavelet representation
                 customized to the ECG signal pattern was found to yield
                 98\% lower entropies compared with other
                 representations that use standard library wavelets. The
                 Classification and Regression Tree (CART) technique
                 seems to distinguish the N vs T, and the S vs T
                 classifications very accurately.",

                 recordings, a challenge currently investigated by a
                 growing number of groups. Our approach is based on the

                 myocardium, and leads to a parameter identification
                 problem for elliptic partial differential equations

                 tissue conductivities of the ischemic heart (forward
                 case). In a second case, we evaluated uncertainty in
                 reconstructed activation times on the epicardium
                 resulting from variation in the control parameter of
                 Tikhonov regularization (inverse case). To overcome
                 difficulties associated with uncertainty visualization,
                 we implemented linked-view windows and interactive
                 animation to the two respective cases. Through
                 dimensionality reduction and superimposed mean and
                 standard deviation measures over time, we were able to
                 display key features in large ensembles of data and
                 highlight regions of interest where larger
                 uncertainties exist. View full abstract",

                 Dynamic properties of electrically coupled cells, each

                 Simulation results demonstrate at least four distinct

                 a) independent oscillation (Gc &lt; 1 pS); b) complex

                 during arrhythmias, including accessory
                 atrioventricular conduction activation. The aim of this
                 study was to report a single center&apos;s clinical
                 experience validating a novel, noninvasive, whole
                 heart, beat-by-beat, 3-dimensional mapping technology
                 with invasive electrophysiological studies, including
                 ablation, where applicable.METHODS AND RESULTS:Using an
                 electrocardiographic mapping (ECM) system in 27
                 patients, 3-dimensional epicardial activation maps were
                 generated from &gt;250 body surface ECGs using
                 heart-torso geometry obtained from computed tomographic
                 images. ECM activation maps were compared with clinical
                 diagnoses, and confirmed with standard invasive
                 electrophysiological studies mapping. (1) In 6 cases of
                 Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome, ECM accurately
                 identified the ventricular insertion site of an
                 accessory atrioventricular connection. (2) In 10
                 patients with premature ventricular complexes, ECM
                 accurately identified their ventricular site of origin
                 in 8 patients. In 2 of 10 patients transient premature
                 ventricular complex suppression was observed during
                 ablation at the site predicted by ECM as the earliest.
                 (3) In 10 cases of atrial tachycardia/atrial flutter,
                 ECM accurately identified the chamber of origin in all
                 10, and distinguished isthmus from nonisthmus dependent
                 atrial flutter. (4) In 1 patient with sustained
                 exercise induced ventricular tachycardia, ECM
                 accurately identified the focal origin in the left
                 ventricular outflow tract.CONCLUSIONS:ECM successfully
                 provided valid activation sequence maps obtained
                 noninvasively in a variety of rhythm disorders that

                 chest pain were diagnosed according to the Traditional
                 Chest Pain Protocol, which included testing of serial
                 blood samples for creatine kinase (CK)-MB and total CK.
                 These patients were also subjected to the Accelerated

                 testing at shortened intervals for myoglobin and

                 Diagnostic sensitivity and specificity were compared
                 versus the final assigned diagnosis. The Accelerated
                 Chest Pain Protocol was implemented for routine use.
                 Follow-up evaluations were conducted at 1 month (test

                 fluid-solid geometries, such as the cardiac
                 environment, is a critical but often overlooked
                 challenge in biomechanical computations. This is
                 particularly true in problems with Lagrangian
                 interfaces, where the fluid and solid phases share a
                 common interface geometrically. For simplicity and
                 better accuracy, it is also highly desirable for the
                 two phases to have a matching surface mesh at the
                 interface between them. We outline a method for solving
                 this problem, and illustrate the approach with a 3D
                 fluid-solid mesh of the mouse heart. An MRI dataset of
                 a perfusion-fixed mouse heart with 50 microm isotropic
                 resolution was semi-automatically segmented using a
                 customized multimaterial connected-threshold approach
                 that divided the volume into non-overlapping regions of
                 blood, tissue, and background. Subsequently a
                 multimaterial marching cubes algorithm was applied to
                 the segmented data to produce two detailed, compatible
                 isosurfaces, one for blood and one for tissue. Both
                 isosurfaces were simultaneously smoothed with a
                 multimaterial smoothing algorithm that exactly
                 conserves the volume for each phase. Using these two
                 isosurfaces, we developed and applied novel automated
                 meshing algorithms to generate anisotropic hybrid
                 meshes on arbitrary biological geometries with the
                 number of layers and the desired element anisotropy for
                 each phase as the only input parameters. Since our
                 meshes adapt to the local feature sizes and include
                 boundary layer prisms, they are more efficient and
                 accurate than non-adaptive, isotropic meshes, and the
                 fluid-structure interaction computations will tend to
                 have relative error equilibrated over the whole mesh.",

                 diagnosis and treatment of coronary artery disease rely
                 on correct integration of data on coronary anatomy and
                 myocardial perfusion. The purpose of this article is to
                 introduce a new left ventricular segmentation model for
                 improved alignment of coronary arterial segments and
                 myocardial perfusion territories, designed for the
                 CORE320 study.METHODS AND RESULTS:CORE320 is a
                 prospective, multicenter study with a primary objective
                 to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of 320-row detector
                 computed tomography (CT) to detect coronary artery
                 luminal stenosis and corresponding myocardial perfusion
                 deficits in patients with suspected coronary artery
                 disease compared with the gold standard of conventional
                 coronary angiography and single-photon emission CT
                 myocardial perfusion imaging. We describe a 19-coronary
                 segment and 13-myocardial territory alignment model,
                 its application in both standard and CT image data
                 sets, and the adjudication process of the initial
                 cohort of patients recruited for the CORE320 study.
                 Adjudication committees reviewed the images of the
                 first 101 gold standard and 107 CT data sets. On the
                 basis of the presented model and rules, all cases for
                 adjudication were correctly identified. During image
                 review, 6 (5.9\%) gold standard and 9 (8.4\%) CT data
                 sets needed further realignment not triggered by the

                 assessment of cardiac arrhythmias by combining body
                 surface electrocardiographic (ECG) mapping (BSM) and
                 imaging.This study was approved by the institutional
                 review board, and all patients gave written informed
                 consent. Twenty-seven patients referred for
                 electrophysiologic procedures in the context of
                 ventricular tachycardia (VT) (n = 9),
                 Wolff-Parkinson-White (WPW) syndrome (n = 2), atrial
                 fibrillation (AF) (n = 13), or scar-related ventricular
                 fibrillation (VF) (n = 3) were examined. Patients
                 underwent BSM and imaging with multidetector computed
                 tomography (CT) (n = 12) and/or delayed enhanced
                 magnetic resonance (MR) imaging (n = 23). BSM was
                 performed by using a 252-electrode vest that enabled
                 the computation of epicardial electrograms from body
                 surface potentials. The epicardial geometry used for
                 BSM was registered to the epicardial geometry segmented
                 from imaging data by using an automatic algorithm. The
                 output was a three-dimensional cardiac model that
                 integrated cardiac anatomy, myocardial substrate, and
                 epicardial activation.Acquisition, segmentation, and
                 registration were feasible in all patients. In VT, this
                 enabled a noninvasive assessment of the arrhythmia
                 mechanism and its location with respect to the
                 myocardial substrate, coronary vessels, and phrenic
                 nerve. In WPW syndrome, this enabled understanding of
                 complex accessory pathways resistant to previous
                 ablation. In AF and VF, this enabled the noninvasive
                 assessment of arrhythmia mechanisms and the analysis of
                 rotor trajectories with respect to the myocardial
                 substrate. In all patients, models were successfully
                 integrated in navigation systems and used to guide
                 mapping and ablation.By combining information on
                 anatomy, substrate, and electrical activation, the
                 fusion of BSM and imaging enables comprehensive
                 noninvasive assessment of cardiac arrhythmias, with
                 potential applications for diagnosis, prognosis, and
                 ablation targeting. Online supplemental material is

                 (d-c MCG) in seven dogs undergoing coronary artery
                 occlusion. The purpose of the measurements was to
                 clarify the origin of the S-T shift in acute ischemia
                 and infarction. Previous measurements, consisting of
                 d-c electrograms recorded from the exposed epicardial
                 surface in situ, are partially inconsistent; also, they
                 are not necessarily representative of the surface
                 electrocardiogram (ECG), which sums broadly over the
                 myocardium. The d-c MCG allows steady myocardial
                 currents in the intact torso to the measured
                 externally; because the d-c MCG sums broadly over these
                 currents, conclusions drawn from it are applicable to
                 the ECG. Coronary artery occlusion was produced by
                 inflating a tube which, about 1 week earlier, had been
                 surgically installed around the artery and
                 exteriorized. During occlusions carried out in the MIT
                 magnetically shielded room, a sensitive magnetometer
                 recorded the d-c MCG at various locations around the
                 torso. Within 20 seconds after occlusion, equal and
                 opposite S-T segment and base-line (d-c) shifts
                 appeared on the d-c MCG; these shifts were maintained
                 for at least 15 minutes, after which they slowly
                 decreased. Therefore, during the acute ischemia
                 produced by these occlusions, the S-T shift is a
                 secondary result of a primary injury current that is
                 interrupted during the S-T interval.",

                 shift associated with the S-T depression. Results are
                 presented of a well-documented patient, with typical
                 coronary artery disease, undergoing a two-step exercise
                 test. Before exercise, there was no S-T or baseline
                 shift. During exercise, the S-T segment became
                 depressed and the baseline segment was simultaneously
                 elevated, at about 70\% of the S-T amplitude. After
                 termination of exercise, the baseline elevation
                 disappeared somewhat more rapidly than the S-T
                 depression. These results were consistent in repeated
                 tests of this patient. Because the baseline shift is a
                 reflection of an injury current, these results confirm
                 the belief that exercise-induced S-T depression is
                 mostly due to an injury current which is interrupted
                 during the S-T interval. The baseline shift seen here
                 is the first non-invasive measurement of an injury
                 current in the human heart, and its presence and
                 time-course generally agree with measurements in the

                 layer to suffer. Conventional two-dimensional

                 extension of myocardial ischemia or infarction, showing
                 akinesia also when only the subendocardium is affected.
                 Novel ultrasonographic techniques (like tissue

                 of [K+]o was observed at seven sites (of 39 sites

                 coronary flow was inversely related to occluded zone
                 size (P less than 0.001) and had a small but
                 significant effect on the severity of arrhythmias; slow
                 recovery of flow increased susceptibility. We conclude
                 that when reperfusion is elicited at the moment of peak
                 susceptibility to arrhythmias, VF incidence is
                 determined principally by occluded zone size. Heart
                 rate during ischemia becomes relevant at rates less
                 than 150 beats/min, when a protective effect is seen.
                 Since VF incidence was 100\% in hearts reperfused after
                 global ischemia, an interface between non-ischemic
                 tissue and reperfused tissue is therefore unnecessary
                 for arrhythmogenesis during reperfusion, and flow of
                 injury current between non-ischemic and reperfused
                 tissue can be ruled out as a mechanism of
                 arrhythmogenesis. The initiation of reperfusion-induced
                 arrhythmias must therefore take place within the
                 reperfused tissue.",

                 of applications involving 3D geometric shapes. Since
                 exact computation of the medial axis is difficult in
                 general, efforts continue to approximate them. One line
                 of research considers the point cloud representation of
                 the boundary surface of a solid and then attempts to
                 compute an approximate medial axis from this point
                 sample. It is known that the Voronoi vertices converge
                 to the medial axis for a curve in 2D as the sample
                 density approaches infinity. Unfortunately, the same is
                 not true in 3D. Recently, it is discovered that a
                 subset of Voronoi vertices called poles converge to the
                 medial axis in 3D. However, in practice, a continuous
                 approximation as opposed to a discrete one is
                 sought.Recently few algorithms have been proposed which
                 use the Voronoi diagram and its derivatives to compute
                 this continuous approximation. These algorithms are
                 scale or density dependent. Most of them do not have
                 convergence guarantees, and one of them computes it
                 indirectly from the power diagram of the poles.
                 Recently, we proposed a new algorithm that approximates
                 the medial axis straight from the Voronoi diagram in a
                 scale and density independent manner with convergence
                 guarantees. In this paper, we present several
                 experimental results with this algorithm that support
                 our theoretical claims and also show its effectiveness

  abstract =     "BACKGROUND:We report on 5 patients who presented to
                 the emergency department (ED) with chest pain, had
                 negative serum troponin levels, and were discharged
                 with a presumed noncardiac diagnosis. Thereafter,
                 retrospective analysis of Holter monitoring data
                 recorded for a clinical trial revealed ST events
                 indicative of transient myocardial ischemia that was
                 unrecognized clinically.STUDY AIM:The purpose of this
                 analysis was to determine whether initial body surface
                 potential maps estimated from optimal ischemia
                 electrode sites estimated body surface potential map
                 (EBSPM) showed signs of ischemia in the missed ischemia
                 group that could have prevented
                 misdiagnosis.METHODS:This is a secondary analysis of
                 data from a prospective clinical trial in which
                 patients were attached to 2 Holter monitor devices for
                 simultaneous recordings. One Holter device recorded a
                 standard Mason-Likar 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG)
                 and the other recorded a 10-electrode lead set
                 considered optimal for ischemia detection. A body
                 surface potential map was then estimated from the
                 optimal lead set.RESULTS:At 1 year, 2 of the 5 patients
                 with missed ischemia died and a third had an acute
                 myocardial infarction (MI) (40\% mortality, 60\%
                 death/nonfatal MI). In comparison, 1-year mortality was
                 5.7\% in 159 similar patients treated for unstable
                 angina at the same institution over the same period (P
                 = .037). The initial standard ECG showed no
                 abnormalities in 3 patients and showed left ventricular
                 hypertrophy in 1. The fifth patient with a history of
                 recent MI had slight ST elevation in leads III and aVF
                 and Q waves that were considered indicative of recent
                 (not acute) MI. EBSPM data recorded at the time of ED
                 presentation matched the standard ECG (normal in 3,
                 left ventricular hypertrophy or inconclusive in 2).
                 During transient ischemia, all 5 EBSPMs showed areas of
                 ischemia overlapping with standard electrode
                 sites.CONCLUSION:Patients evaluated in the ED for chest
                 pain are at high risk for death or nonfatal MI if they
                 have ischemic events with continuous ST-segment
                 monitoring that are unrecognized clinically. In this
                 small cohort with unrecognized ischemia, the initial
                 body surface potential maps estimated from optimal
                 ischemia electrode sites did not improve on 12-lead
                 ST-segment monitoring to identify this high-risk

                 encountered during 12-lead ST-segment monitoring of
                 patients in a cardiac care unit. Of 292 patients, 117
                 (40\%) had one or more false positive events during an
                 average of 41 hours of ST-segment monitoring, for a
                 total of 506 false positive events. The 506 false
                 positive events included 167 (36\%) due to body
                 positional change; 132 (26\%) due to sudden increase in
                 QRS complex/ST-segment voltage; 96 (19\%) due to

                 (5\%) due to a noisy signal; and 5 (1\%) due to lead

                 ST-segment deviation in patients with unstable coronary
                 syndromes. Accurate ST-segment monitoring requires

                 body surface potential maps, recorded during
                 percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty
                 protocols, using a realistic geometry computer heart
                 model. Other objectives were to address the question of
                 reciprocal ST-segment changes observed in the 12-lead
                 electrocardiogram during ischemia and to verify the
                 hypothesis that the shortening of the QRS duration
                 observed in left anterior descending (LAD) coronary
                 artery occlusion may be explained by conduction delay
                 in the septal His-Purkinje system. Simulation was
                 achieved by first introducing into the heart model
                 three transmural zones of mild, moderate, and severe
                 ischemia for assumed occlusions in the LAD, left
                 circumflex, and right coronary arteries. The heart
                 model was then excited, in turn, with these three zones
                 present for assumed occlusions in the LAD, left
                 circumflex, and right coronary arteries. Myocardial
                 conduction velocities in the regions of moderate and
                 severe ischemia were assumed to be reduced to 75 and
                 50\% of normal, respectively. Model action potentials
                 in the mild, moderate, and severely ischemic zones were
                 also altered to reflect known ischemic changes in these
                 action potentials. Body surface potential maps and
                 electrocardiograms were computed by placing the heart
                 inside a numerical torso model. Simulated map patterns
                 during both ST-segment and QRS were qualitatively
                 similar to clinical maps. Reciprocal ST-segment
                 depression was observed for all three occlusions in
                 remote leads that did not overlie the ischemic zones.
                 QRS shortening due to septal His-Purkinje conduction
                 delay was verified. The simulation results attest to
                 the model&apos;s ability to reproduce body surface
                 potential distributions recorded following percutaneous
                 transluminal coronary angioplasty protocols. The
                 simulations also showed that reciprocal ST-segment
                 changes occur as a natural consequence of the primary
                 ischemic region and that there is no need to invoke a
                 second region of ischemia. Finally, the model
                 demonstrated that QRS shortening can occur in LAD
                 occlusion despite a slowing of conduction down the
                 septal His-Purkinje system.",

                 arrhythmology, and frequently used for the explanation
                 of many types of clinical tachyarrhythmias, are often
                 based on experiments on unusual models, unphysiologic

                 interpreted histologic findings. However, it can be
                 demonstrated that several of these hypotheses are
                 valid. Focal activity, unidirectional block, extremely
                 slow conduction velocity, differences in conduction
                 velocity in closely adjacent regions, reentry of the
                 excitation wave, circulating excitation waves in small

                 occlusion of a coronary artery. We investigated the
                 influence of a passive vortex current distribution,
                 modelled by different conductivities in a hollow
                 cylinder, on the localization error and on the signal
                 strength in both the magnetocardiogram and the
                 electrocardiogram. The hollow cylinder was mounted in a
                 realistically shaped physical torso phantom. A platinum
                 dipole was inserted into the cylinder. The compartment
                 boundaries were modelled with two special ionic
                 exchange membranes. The conductivity ratio of the
                 cylinder compartment to the torso compartment was
                 varied from 0.25 to 100. We compared the simultaneously
                 measured magnetic and electric signal strengths as a
                 function of this conductivity ratio. We found that an
                 increasing conductivity ratio causes only a slight
                 increase (about 19\%) of the magnetic signal strength
                 but a strong decrease (about 81\%) of the electric
                 signal strength. Using a homogeneous torso model, the
                 dipole localization errors were, depending on the
                 conductivity ratio, up to 16 mm. In conclusion, passive
                 vortex currents might partially explain the differences
                 between magnetocardiographic and electrocardiographic

                 common hospital-based major interventional procedures
                 performed in the United States. It is uncertain how new
                 revascularization technologies, new clinical evidence
                 from trials, and updated clinical guidelines have
                 influenced the volume and distribution of coronary
                 revascularizations over the past decade.OBJECTIVE:To
                 examine national time trends in the rates and types of
                 coronary revascularizations.DESIGN, SETTING, AND
                 PATIENTS:A serial cross-sectional study with time
                 trends of patients undergoing coronary artery bypass
                 graft (CABG) surgery or percutaneous coronary
                 interventions (PCIs) between 2001 and 2008 at US
                 hospitals in the Healthcare Cost and Utilization
                 Project&apos;s Nationwide Inpatient Sample, which
                 reports inpatient coronary revascularizations. These
                 data were supplemented by Medicare outpatient hospital

                 coronary revascularizations, CABG surgery, and
                 PCI.RESULTS:A 15\% decrease (P &lt; .001) in the annual
                 rate of coronary revascularizations was observed from
                 2001-2002 to 2007-2008. The annual CABG surgery rate
                 decreased steadily from 1742 (95\% confidence interval
                 [CI], 1663-1825) CABG surgeries per million adults per
                 year in 2001-2002 to 1081 (95\% CI, 1032-1133) CABG
                 surgeries per million adults per year in 2007-2008 (P
                 &lt; .001), but PCI rates did not significantly change
                 (3827 [95\% CI, 3578-4092] PCI per million adults per
                 year in 2001-2002 vs 3667 [95\% CI, 3429-3922] PCI per
                 million adults per year in 2007-2008, P = .74). Between
                 2001 and 2008, the number of hospitals in the
                 Nationwide Inpatient Sample providing CABG surgery
                 increased by 12\% (212 in 2001 vs 241 in 2008, P =
                 .03), and the number of PCI hospitals increased by 26\%
                 (246 in 2001 vs 331 in 2008, P &lt; .001). The median
                 CABG surgery caseload per hospital decreased by 28\%
                 (median [interquartile range], 253 [161-458] in 2001 vs
                 183 [98-292] in 2008; P &lt; .001) and the number of
                 CABG surgery hospitals providing fewer than 100 CABG
                 surgeries per year increased from 23 (11\%) in 2001 to
                 62 (26\%) in 2008 (P &lt; .001).CONCLUSIONS:In US
                 hospitals between 2001 and 2008, a substantial decrease
                 in CABG surgery utilization rates was observed, but PCI

                 measurements is increasingly being seen as a technology
                 with the potential for use in the clinic, for example
                 for pre-procedure planning or during-treatment guidance
                 for ventricular arrhythmia ablation procedures. However
                 several important impediments to widespread adoption of
                 this technology remain to be effectively overcome. Here
                 we address two of these impediments: the difficulty of
                 reconstructing electric potentials on the inner
                 (endocardial) as well as outer (epicardial) surfaces of
                 the ventricles, and the need for full anatomical
                 imaging of the subject&apos;s thorax to build an
                 accurate subject-specific geometry. We introduce two
                 new features in our reconstruction algorithm: a
                 nonlinear low-order dynamic parameterization derived
                 from the measured body surface signals, and a technique
                 to jointly regularize both surfaces. With these
                 methodological innovations in combination, it is
                 possible to reconstruct endocardial activation from
                 clinically acquired measurements with an imprecise
                 thorax geometry. In particular we test the method using
                 body surface potentials acquired from three subjects
                 during clinical procedures where the subjects&apos;
                 hearts were paced on their endocardia using a catheter
                 device. Our geometric models were constructed using a
                 set of CT scans limited in axial extent to the
                 immediate region near the heart. The catheter system
                 provides a reference location to which we compare our
                 results. We compare our estimates of pacing site
                 localization, in terms of both accuracy and stability,
                 to those reported in a recent clinical publication ,
                 where a full set of CT scans were available and only

                 increase. The goal of this 2-part article is to review

                 of the ACS patient, and to propose an optimal treatment

                 the realities, culture, and delivery of healthcare in
                 Canada. ACS patients are categorized as either ST
                 segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) or
                 non-ST-elevation ACS (NSTE-ACS). For the patients with
                 NSTE-ACS, prevention of recurrent ischemic events is
                 the primary goal. Assessment of risk for recurrent
                 ischemic and bleeding events helps to determine the net
                 benefit of early cardiac catheterization and
                 percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) and intensive
                 antiplatelet and anticoagulant treatment. Those with
                 higher ischemic risk features should be considered for
                 an early invasive strategy and receive both dual
                 antiplatelet therapy and an anticoagulant at the time

  abstract =     "Epicardial and endocardial pacing are widely used, yet
                 little is known about the three-dimensional
                 distribution of potentials generated by the pacing
                 stimulus or the spread of activation from these pacing
                 sites. In six open-chest dogs, simultaneous recordings
                 were made from 120 transmural electrodes in 40 plunge
                 electrodes within a 35 X 20 X 5-mm portion of the right
                 ventricular outflow tract during epicardial and
                 endocardial pacing at a strength of twice diastolic
                 threshold and at 1 mA. The magnitude of extracellular
                 potentials generated by the stimulus and the activation
                 times were compared in regions proximal (less than
                 10-12 mm) and distal to the pacing site. Local fiber
                 orientation was histologically determined at each
                 recording electrode. For endocardial pacing,
                 endocardial potentials were larger than epicardial
                 potentials only in the proximal region (p less than
                 0.001); while in the distal region, epicardial
                 potentials were larger (p less than 0.001), and
                 endocardial activation occurred earlier than epicardial
                 activation for both regions (p less than 0.001). For
                 epicardial pacing, epicardial potentials were larger
                 than endocardial potentials in both regions (p less
                 than 0.001), and epicardial activation occurred earlier
                 only in the proximal region (p less than 0.02), while
                 endocardial activation occurred before epicardial
                 activation in the distal region (p less than 0.01). In
                 planes of recording electrodes parallel to the
                 epicardium and endocardium, the initial isochrones were
                 elliptical with the major axes of the ellipses along
                 the mean fiber orientation between the pacing site and
                 recording plane rather than along the local fiber
                 orientation in the recording plane. Thus, the ellipses
                 in each plane rotated with respect to each other so
                 that in three dimensions the activation front was
                 helicoid, yet the twist of the helix was less than that
                 of the corresponding transmural rotation of fibers. For
                 pacing from the right ventricular outflow tract, we
                 conclude that beyond 10-12 mm from endocardial and
                 epicardial pacing sites epicardial stimulus potentials
                 in both cases are larger than endocardial potentials
                 because of resistivity differences inside and outside
                 the heart wall and activation in both cases is
                 primarily endocardial to epicardial because of rapid
                 endocardial conduction, and we conclude that the
                 initial spread of activation is helicoid and determined
                 by transmural fiber direction.",

                 changes in body position (BPC) during electrocardiogram
                 (ECG) recording. These changes are often manifested as
                 shifts in the electrical axis and may be misclassified
                 as ischemic changes during ambulatory monitoring. We
                 investigate two ECG signal processing methods for
                 detecting BPCs. Different schemes for feature
                 extraction are used (spatial and scalar), while
                 preprocessing, trend postprocessing and detection are
                 identical. The spatial approach is based on VCG loop
                 rotation angles and the scalar approach is based on the
                 Karhunen-LoÃ¨ve transform (KLT) coefficients. The
                 methods are evaluated on two different databases: a
                 database with annotated BPCs and the STAFF III database
                 with recordings from rest and during
                 angioplasty-induced ischemia but not including BPCs.
                 The angle-based detector results in performance values
                 of detection probability PD = 95\%, false alarm
                 probability PF = 3\% in the BPC database and false
                 alarm rate in the STAFF III database in control ECGs
                 during rest RF(c) = 2 h(-1) (episodes per hour) and in
                 ischemia recordings during angioplasty RF(a) = 7 h(-1),
                 whereas the KLT-based detector produces values of PD =
                 89\%, PF = 3\%, RF(c) = 4 h(-1), and RF(a) = 11 h(-1),
                 respectively. Including information on noise level in
                 the detection process to reduce the number of false
                 alarms, performance values of PD approximately equal to
                 90\%, PF approximately equal to 1\%, RF(c)
                 approximately equal to 1 h(-1) and RF(a) approximately
                 equal to 2 h(-1) are obtained with both methods. It is
                 concluded that reliable detection of BPCs may be
                 achieved using the ECG signal and should work in
                 parallel to ischemia detectors.",

                 challenges for implementation. In the specific case of
                 the forward problem in electrocardiography, the lack of
                 robust, feasible, and comprehensive sensitivity
                 analysis has left many aspects of the problem

                 These physiologically unrealistic discontinuities
                 result from the switching on of the elementary surface
                 source elements based on the timing of activation
                 assigned to their nodes. Two new methods for avoiding
                 such discontinuities are introduced and their
                 effectiveness is analyzed. In the first method only the
                 contributions of the activated parts of the source
                 elements are evaluated. This results in a more
                 physiologically realistic description of cardiac source
                 activity and is referred to as the gold standard. In
                 addition, a faster, approximate method was developed,

                 the other through the cell membrane. Electric
                 potentials in interstitial space are shown to be

                 magnetocardiogram. The problem is considerably

                 However, L2-norm penalty function can cause

                 propagation, based on a reaction-diffusion model with
                 an anisotropic inhomogeneous electrical
                 conductivity-tensor field. Then, we propose a novel
                 parallel optimization algorithm for solving the complex
                 inverse problem of estimating the electrical
                 conductivity-tensor field. Specifically, we propose a
                 single-step approximation with a parallel
                 block-relaxation optimization routine that simplifies
                 the joint tensor field estimation problem into a set of
                 computationally tractable subproblems, allowing the use
                 of efficient standard optimization tools. Finally,
                 using numerical examples of several electrical
                 conductivity field topologies and noise levels, we
                 analyze the performance of our algorithm, and discuss
                 its application to real measurements obtained from
                 smooth-muscle cardiac tissue, using data collected with
                 a high-resolution MEA system.",

In the biological context, mathematical models help us understand the complex web of interrelations between various components (DNA, proteins, enzymes, signaling molecules etc.) in a biological system, gain better understanding of the system as a whole, and in turn predict its behavior in an altered state (e.g. disease). Mathematical modeling has enhanced our understanding of multiple complex biological processes like enzyme kinetics, metabolic networks, signal transduction pathways, gene regulatory networks, and electrophysiology. With recent advances in high throughput data generation methods, computational techniques and mathematical modeling have become even more central to the study of biological systems. In this review, we provide a brief history and highlight some of the important applications of modeling in biological systems with an emphasis on the study of excitable cells. We conclude with a discussion about opportunities and challenges for mathematical modeling going forward. In a larger sense, the review is designed to help answer a simple but important question that theoreticians frequently face from interested but skeptical colleagues on the experimental side: ?What is the value of a model??",

                 from the apex to the base of the canine left
                 ventricular wall. An elastance model for active fiber
                 stress was incorporated in an axisymmetric model that
                 accurately represented the geometry and fiber angle
                 distribution of the anterior free wall. The nonlinear
                 constitutive equation for the resting myocardium was
                 transversely isotropic with respect to the local fiber
                 axis. Transmural distributions of end-diastolic fiber
                 stress became increasingly nonuniform from midventricle
                 toward the apex or the base. At a typical diastolic
                 left ventricular pressure (1 kPa), the differences
                 between largest and smallest fiber stresses were only
                 0.5 kPa near midventricle, compared with 4.6 kPa at the

                 differences at end-systole (14 kPa) were relatively
                 small in regions from the base to the midventricle
                 (13-22 kPa), but were larger between midventricle and

                 in-plane normal and shear strains also agreed closely

                 leads from selected leads is computed according to the
                 least squares optimization, and the performance is
                 evaluated in terms of the mean square error of the
                 derived potentials and correlation. The algorithms were

                 Each data set was divided into a study and test

                 placed within a realistically shaped human torso model.
                 The transfer coefficients relating the individual
                 dipoles to the torso surface potentials, as well as the
                 body surface potential maps, the vectorcardiogram, and
                 the 12-lead electrocardiogram resulting due to normal
                 activation of the heart model, were calculated for each

                 homogeneous + skeletal muscle layer, homogeneous +
                 muscle layer + lungs, and homogeneous + muscle layer +
                 lungs + intraventricular blood masses. The effects of
                 each inhomogeneity were deduced by comparing results

                 surface potential maps, the major qualitative effects
                 were an augmentation of the head-to-foot component of
                 the vectorcardiogram due to the lungs, and a

                 masses, muscle layer, and, to a lesser extent, the
                 lungs. Besides the above qualitative effects of the
                 inhomogeneities, there were also large quantitative
                 effects on the surface potentials, namely, magnitude
                 increases due to the blood masses and magnitude

                 because very high voltages close to defibrillation
                 electrodes demand that extreme time step restrictions
                 be placed on standard numerical schemes, e.g. the

                 ventricular myocardium. 3-DCAI entails the modeling and
                 estimation of the cardiac equivalent current density
                 (ECD) distribution from which the activation time at
                 any myocardial site is determined as the time point
                 with the peak amplitude of local ECD estimates. In this
                 paper, we report, for the first time, an in vivo
                 validation study assessing the feasibility of 3-DCAI in
                 comparison with the 3-D intracardiac mapping, for a
                 group of four healthy rabbits undergoing the
                 ventricular pacing from various locations. During the

                 intramural bipolar electrical recordings were
                 simultaneously measured in a closed-chest condition.
                 The ventricular activation sequence noninvasively
                 imaged from the body surface measurements by using
                 3-DCAI was generally in agreement with that obtained
                 from the invasive intramural recordings. The
                 quantitative comparison between them showed a root mean
                 square (rms) error of 7.42 +/-0.61 ms, a relative error
                 (RE) of 0.24 +/-0.03, and a localization error (LE) of
                 5.47 +/-1.57 mm. The experimental results were also
                 consistent with our computer simulations conducted in

                 (e.g., the activation origin and the activation
                 sequence), and has the potential of becoming a useful

                 studies. Study of progressive alterations of the
                 intracoronary S-T segment after proximal occlusion of
                 the left anterior descending coronary artery in 18
                 closed chest dogs revealed a peak segment elevation of
                 3.2 +/- 0.6 mv within 5 minutes, followed within 2 to 3
                 hours by spontaneous reduction by more than 40\% of the
                 S-T elevation over the occluded zone. In 44\% of these
                 animals, the S-T elevation decreased spontaneously to
                 less than 1 mv, and in 22\% it decreased to the
                 preocclusion control level within 2 hours of occlusion.
                 This spontaneous decrease in S-T elevation was
                 frequently followed by a secondary increase and then
                 S-T segment fluctuations. Reperfusion of the left
                 anterior descending coronary artery after 30 to 60
                 minutes of occlusion generally led to a prompt
                 reduction in S-T elevation. In some cases S-T
                 elevations persisted up to 14 hours of occlusion, were
                 reduced after reperfusion and exhibited a renewed
                 pronounced increase after subsequent reocclusion of the
                 left anterior descending coronary artery. During the
                 1st hour after occlusion, the early S-T segment
                 elevation followed by spontaneous reduction reduction
                 generally corresponded temporally with the derangements
                 in myocardial lactate extraction and potassium loss.
                 However, after 1 hour of occlusion no clear-cut
                 correlation could be established between S-T
                 fluctuations and changes in hemodynamic or myocardial
                 metabolic measurements. We conclude that the new closed
                 chest intracoronary electrocardiographic S-T technique
                 might be of use for monitoring the early ischemic
                 myocardial derangements and to assess benefits or
                 drawbacks of treatment in both the experimental animal
                 and man. Correspondence of S-T segment elevation with
                 lactate and potassium alterations in the
                 coronary-occluded region in the 1st hour after
                 occlusion indicates that S-T segment elevation might
                 represent an index of early myocardial ischemia. The
                 spontaneous S-T changes that follow coronary occlusion
                 must be taken into consideration when investigators
                 utilize S-T segment modification as a sign of
                 effectiveness of treatment.",

                 used to study risk factors for POAF, comparing patients

                 was higher following AVR (74\%) than after CABG (44\%)

                 longer hospital stay, higher rates of complications,
                 and operative mortality (5\% vs. 0.7\%). In

                 ST elevation, (2) TQ and ST segment changes in
                 magnitude and polarity are complex functions of
                 ischemic size, shape, and transmural location; (3)
                 precordial electrocardiogram (ECG) ST segment elevation
                 is directly related to ischemic size; and (4)
                 epicardial ECG ST segment elevation is inversely
                 related to ischemic size. It is thus concluded that
                 precordial and epicardial ECG TQ and ST segment
                 deflections are complex functions of ischemic geometry
                 and that their accurate interpretation with respect to
                 ischemic size and shape and in the presence of
                 pharmacological interventions is often difficult and
                 may be misleading.",

                 utilized as a means of assessing the degree of
                 underlying ischemic injury, the relationship of QRS
                 complex alterations to the ischemic process is poorly
                 understood. In this study we made a beat-to-beat
                 analysis of the QRS complex in terms of ventricular
                 activation time (CT) and R wave voltage (V) in the
                 acutely ischemic porcine myocardium and analyzed the
                 relationship of these responses to changes in the area
                 of ischemic involvement, altered myocardial energy
                 demands, and plasma [K+]0 levels. With the onset of
                 ischemia the QRS complex underwent a specific and
                 reproducible biphasic sequence with an initial decrease
                 in CT and V indicating a transient increase in the
                 conduction velocity of the ischemic tissue.
                 Subsequently both CT and V returned briefly to control
                 and then increased dramatically, now indicating a
                 marked decrease in conduction velocity. The time when
                 CT first began to increase (Tc) was shortened by
                 enlarging the area of ischemia or after an inotropic
                 intervention and was lengthened by decreasing the area
                 of ischemia or with administration of propranolol.
                 Moreover Tc was found to be inversely proportional to
                 plasma [K+]0 in the range 3.4-8.8 mM, above which the
                 initial decrease in CT and V was no longer present. We
                 conclude that this biphasic sequence of QRS alterations
                 in early myocardial ischemia is attributable to a
                 progressive leakage of potassium out of the ischemic
                 cells which in turn alters both the time-course and
                 transmural pathway of the activation process through
                 the ischemic tissue. These changes are related to both
                 inotropic state and the area of ischemic involvement.",

                 the epicardial surface over the border between normal
                 and ischemic tissue is proposed. Depression is caused
                 by current flowing in a transmural loop that begins and
                 ends at the lateral boundary between healthy and
                 ischemic tissue and passes through the transmural
                 boundary between healthy and ischemic tissue. The
                 result is ST depression at the epicardium over the
                 lateral boundary. The size and direction of current
                 flow are dictated by differences in the magnitude and
                 orientation of anisotropic conductivity between those

                 that result from subendocardial ischemia. We performed
                 computer simulations of ischemia with a realistic whole
                 heart model. The model included a patch of
                 subendocardial ischemic tissue of variable transmural
                 thickness with reduced action potential amplitude. We
                 also varied both intracellular and extracellular
                 conductivities of the heart and the conductivity of
                 ventricular blood in the simulations. At medium or high
                 thicknesses of transmural ischemia (i.e., at least 40\%
                 thickness through the heart wall), a consistent pattern
                 of two minima of the epicardial potential over opposite
                 sides of the boundary between healthy and ischemic
                 tissue appeared on the epicardium over a wide range of
                 conductivity values. The magnitude of the net
                 epicardial potential difference, the epicardial maximum
                 minus the epicardial minimum, was strongly correlated
                 to the intracellular to extracellular conductivity
                 ratios both along and across fibers. Anisotropy of the
                 ischemic source region was critical in predicting

                 away from the ischemic region had a less significant
                 impact on epicardial potentials. Subendocardial
                 ischemia that extends through at least 40\% of the
                 heart wall is manifest on the epicardium by at least
                 one area of ST-segment depression located over a
                 boundary between ischemic and healthy tissue. The

                 voltage to decrease by a certain voltage, DeltaV. The
                 timing of the plateau is shown to be controlled by two
                 slowly changing gate variables, the inactivation gate
                 that controls the inward/depolarizing L-type calcium
                 current and the inactivation gate that controls the
                 outward/repolarizing slow rectifier potassium current.
                 The amount of current controlled by these variables is
                 a function of the net conductivity of the corresponding
                 sodium and potassium channels. An equation is derived

                 combine distinct finite element meshes into a single
                 system. The present work describes a scheme for
                 coupling a finite element mesh, which may have
                 curvilinear elements, to a voxel based finite element
                 mesh.METHODS:The method is described with reference to
                 a sample problem that involves combining a heart, which
                 is defined by a curvilinear mesh, with a voxel based
                 torso mesh. The method involves the creation of a
                 temporary (scaffolding) mesh that couples the outer
                 surface of the heart mesh to a voxel based torso mesh.
                 The inner surface of the scaffolding mesh is the outer
                 heart surface, and the outer surface of the scaffolding
                 mesh is defined by the nodes in the torso mesh that are
                 nearest (but outside of) the heart. The finite element
                 stiffness matrix for the scaffolding mesh is then
                 computed. This stiffness matrix includes extraneous
                 nodes that are then removed, leaving a coupling matrix
                 that couples the original outer heart surface nodes to
                 adjacent nodes in the torso voxel mesh. Finally, a
                 complete system matrix is assembled from the
                 pre-existing heart stiffness matrix, the heart/torso
                 coupling matrix, and the torso stiffness
                 matrix.RESULTS:Realistic body surface
                 electrocardiograms were generated. In a test involving
                 a dipole embedded in a spherical shell, relative error
                 of the scheme rapidly converged to slightly over 4\%,
                 although convergence thereafter was relatively
                 slow.CONCLUSION:The described method produces
                 reasonably accurate results and may be best suited for
                 problems where computational speed and convenience have
                 a higher priority than very high levels of accuracy.",

                 (ii) an endocardial transmembrane potential
                 distribution with the lowest transmembrane potentials
                 in the ischemic region; and (iii) overall lower
                 transmembrane potentials to the endocardium compared to
                 the epicardium. Late ST segment potentials, which
                 localized the area of the ischemic region, were
                 generated by reducing the epicardial transmembrane
                 potential gradient and increasing the endocardial
                 transmembrane potential gradient.CONCLUSION:The
                 non-localizing nature of early ST segment depression
                 could be due to global epicardial and endocardial
                 transmembrane potential gradients related to the
                 activation/repolarization sequence, whereas the
                 possibly localizing nature of late ST segment
                 depression could be due to the relative removal of the
                 epicardial gradient, and an increase of the
                 transmembrane potential gradient across the
                 endocardium.",

                 described with reference to a test case involving a
                 rectangular electrode plaque disposed on a heart
                 surface, which is imaged with MRI. Data from the
                 electrodes is fused with the MRI image at the
                 appropriate locations. The registration scheme involves
                 four parts. First, selected landmarks on a data surface
                 (e.g., electrode plaque) are registered to known
                 locations on a target anatomical surface image. Second,
                 the anatomical surface is represented numerically with
                 a spherical harmonic expansion. Third, given the
                 registration of the select data surface landmarks, the
                 location of the outer four corners of the rectangular
                 electrode plaque are located on the anatomical surface.
                 Fourth, a quasi-evenly spaced grid within these four
                 corners is formed on the anatomical surface. The third
                 and fourth steps involve calculating geodesics on the
                 anatomical surface, preferably by utilizing the
                 spherical harmonic expansion. According to the second
                 registration method, spherical harmonics and geodesics
                 are used to extract a mesh from the anatomical surface.
                 Laplace&apos;s equation is solved on this mesh to
                 generate a mapping from the anatomical surface to the

                 been implicated as a trigger for arrhythmias arising

                 the Purkinje-ventricular interface in the development
                 of abnormal automaticity.Patch clamp and electronic
                 cell coupling techniques were used to record action
                 potentials from and to apply injury current to isolated
                 rabbit Purkinje myocytes. Injury current was dependent
                 upon: (1) a coupling resistance, which was varied to
                 simulate different degrees of cellular uncoupling, and
                 (2) the difference in Purkinje membrane potential and
                 depolarized ischemic myocardium, which was represented
                 by a passive resistor-capacitor circuit with initial
                 voltages of -70, -60, or -50 mV.During coupling to the
                 moderately depolarized cell (-60 or -50 mV), Purkinje
                 myocytes developed repetitive, spontaneous activity
                 within a window of coupling resistances. This abnormal
                 automaticity was dependent upon L-type calcium current,

                 demonstrate that injury current alone can induce
                 spontaneous activity in normal Purkinje myocytes. The
                 level of myocardial depolarization and the degree of
                 cellular uncoupling required to induce this activity
                 suggest spontaneous Purkinje activity induced by injury

                 sources arising in exercise electrocardiographic (ECG)
                 tests. The extent and location of the ischemic injury
                 were simulated for both single- and multivessel
                 coronary artery disease by use of an accurate
                 source-volume conductor model which assumes a linear
                 relationship between heart rate and extent of ischemia.
                 The results indicated that in some cases the ST/HR
                 slope in leads II, aVF, and especially V5 may be
                 related to the extent of ischemia. However, the

                 examine electrocardiographic criteria for acute
                 reversible myocardial ischemia. BSPM with 123 channels
                 was performed in 45 patients with coronary artery
                 disease (CAD) and 25 healthy controls during supine
                 bicycle exercise testing. Of the 45 patients, 18
                 patients had anterior, 14 had posterior, and 13 had
                 inferior ischemia documented by coronary angiography
                 and thallium scintigraphy. The ST amplitude was
                 measured 60 ms after the J-point and the ST slope
                 calculated by fitting a regression line from the
                 J-point to 60 ms after it. The optimal locations for
                 detecting ST depression and ST-slope decrease were
                 identified. In the pooled CAD patient group, the
                 optimal location for ST depression was 5 cm below
                 standard lead V(5) (CAD group: -70 +/- 70 microV;
                 controls: 70 +/- 80 microV, p &lt;0.001). Using a
                 cut-off value of -10 microV, the ST depression
                 separated the patients with CAD from controls with a
                 sensitivity of 84\% and a specificity of 96\%. The ST
                 slope became more horizontal in the patient group than
                 in the control group. The optimal location for ST-slope
                 decrease was over the left side (CAD group: 20 +/- 20
                 microV/s; controls: 720 +/- 320 microV/s, p &lt;0.001).
                 Using a cut-off value of 320 microV/s, the ST slope
                 separated patients with CAD from controls with a
                 sensitivity of 93\% at a specificity level of 88\%. The
                 area under the receiver operating characteristic curve
                 of ST slope tended to be higher than the one of ST
                 depression (97\% vs 93\%; p = 0.097). In conclusion,
                 regions sensitive for ST depression and for ST-slope
                 decrease could be identified in BSPM, despite variation
                 in the location of ischemia and the presence or absence
                 of a history of MI. ST slope is a sensitive and
                 specific marker of transient myocardial ischemia, and
                 might perform even better than ST depression.",

                 emergency situation in which immediate measures for
                 myocardial reperfusion are needed. The diagnosis is
                 based on the recognition of ST-segment elevation in the
                 electrocardiogram (ECG). In case of coronary artery
                 occlusion, ST-segment elevation is caused by an injury
                 current from the ischemic myocardium. Rarely, other
                 mechanisms may lead to ECG changes mimicking STEMI. In
                 our case, a 65-year-old man was presented to our
                 institution with ECG abnormalities suggestive of STEMI.
                 However, coronary angiography showed open arteries.
                 Laboratory tests revealed severe hypocalcemia caused by
                 a deficiency of vitamin D. After calcium replacement
                 therapy, the ECG normalized, and the patient was
                 discharged in good condition. Only a few case reports
                 on hypocalcemia-induced ST-segment elevation exist, and
                 the mechanism remains unknown.",

                 Despite this importance, there are only a few
                 therapeutic approaches to protect from
                 ischaemia-reperfusion injury (IRI). In experimental
                 studies, the amino acid glycine effectively protected
                 from IRI. In the prevention of IRI by glycine in cells
                 and isolated perfused or cold-stored organs (tissues),
                 direct cytoprotection plays a crucial role, most likely
                 by prevention of the formation of pathological plasma
                 membrane pores. Under in vivo conditions, the mechanism
                 of protection by glycine is less clear, partly due to
                 the physiological presence of the amino acid. Here,
                 inhibition of the inflammatory response in the injured
                 tissue is considered to contribute decisively to the
                 glycine-induced reduction of IRI. However, attenuation
                 of IRI recently achieved in experimental animals by
                 low-dose glycine treatment regimens suggests
                 additional/other (unknown) protective mechanisms.
                 Despite the convincing experimental evidence and the
                 large therapeutic width of glycine, there are only a
                 few clinical trials on the protection from IRI by
                 glycine with ambivalent results. Thus, both the
                 mechanism(s) behind the protection of glycine against
                 IRI in vivo and its true clinical potential remain to
                 be addressed in future experimental studies/clinical
                 trials.Â© 2011 The Authors. British Journal of

                 cardiac arrhythmia, is an important contributor to
                 population morbidity and mortality. An arrhythmia that
                 is particularly common in the elderly, AF is growing in
                 prevalence with the aging of the population. Our
                 understanding of the basic mechanisms that govern AF
                 occurrence and persistence has been increasing rapidly.
                 This article reviews the basic pathophysiology of AF
                 over a broad range of levels, touching on the tissue
                 mechanisms that maintain the arrhythmia, the
                 relationship between clinical presentation and basic
                 mechanisms, ion channel and transporter abnormalities
                 that lead to ectopic impulse formation, basic models
                 and tissue determinants of reentry, ion channel
                 determinants of reentry, the nature and roles of
                 electric and structural remodeling, autonomic neural
                 components, anatomic factors, interactions between
                 atrial and ventricular functional consequences of AF,
                 and the basic determinants of atrial thromboembolism.
                 We then review the potential implications of the basic
                 pathophysiology of the arrhythmia for its management.
                 We first discuss consequences for improved rhythm
                 control pharmacotherapy: targeting underlying
                 conditions, new atrium-selective drug targets, new
                 targets for focal ectopic source suppression, and
                 upstream therapy aiming to prevent remodeling. We then
                 review the implications of basic mechanistic
                 considerations for rate control therapy, AF ablation,
                 and the prevention of thromboembolic events. We

                 data for 2,320 patients presenting with possible acute

                 normal 41\% of abnormal ST segments and 36\% of
                 abnormal T waves, and misread as abnormal 14\% of
                 normal ST segments and 17\% of normal T waves. Trainees
                 were significantly more sensitive readers of T-wave

                 should be systematic, risk based, and goal driven. An
                 effective program must be able to evaluate all patients
                 with equal thoroughness under the assumption that any
                 patient with chest pain could potentially be having an
                 MI. The initial evaluation is based on the history, a
                 focused physical examination, and the ECG. This
                 information is sufficient to categorize patients into
                 groups at high, moderate, and low risk. Table 14 is a
                 template for a comprehensive chest-pain evaluation
                 program. Patients at high risk need rapid initiation of
                 appropriate therapy: thrombolytics or primary
                 angioplasty for the patients with MIs or
                 aspirin/heparin for the patients with unstable angina.
                 Patients at moderate risk need to have an acute
                 coronary syndrome ruled in or out expediently and
                 additional comorbidities addressed before discharge.
                 Patients at low risk also need to be evaluated, and
                 once the likelihood of an unstable acute coronary
                 syndrome is eliminated, they can be discharged with
                 further evaluation performed as outpatients. Subsequent
                 evaluation should attempt to assign a definitive
                 diagnosis while also addressing issues specific to risk
                 reduction, such as cholesterol lowering and smoking
                 cessation. It is well documented that 4\% to 5\% of
                 patients with MIs are inadvertently missed during the
                 initial evaluation. This number is surprisingly
                 consistent among many studies using various protocols
                 and suggests that an initial evaluation limited to the
                 history, physical examination, and ECG will fail to
                 identify the small number of these patients who
                 otherwise appear at low risk. The solution is to
                 improve the sensitivity of the evaluation process to
                 identify these patients. It appears that more than
                 simple observation is required, and at the present
                 time, no simple laboratory test can meet this need.
                 However, success has been reported with a number of
                 strategies including emergency imaging with either
                 radionuclides such as sestamibi or echocardiography.
                 Early provocative testing, either stress or
                 pharmaceutic, may also be effective. The added value of
                 these tests is only in their use as part of a
                 systematic protocol for the evaluation of all patients
                 with acute chest pain. The initial evaluation of the
                 patient with chest pain should always consider cardiac
                 ischemia as the cause, even in those with more atypical
                 symptoms in whom a cardiac origin is considered less
                 likely. The explicit goals for the evaluation of acute
                 chest pain should be to reduce the time to treat MIs
                 and to reduce the inadvertent discharge of patients
                 with occult acute coronary syndromes. All physicians
                 should become familiar with appropriate risk
                 stratification of patients with acute chest pain.
                 Systematic strategies must be in place to assure rapid
                 and consistent identification of all patients and the
                 expedient initiation of treatment for those patients
                 with acute coronary syndromes. These strategies should
                 include additional methods of identifying acute
                 coronary syndromes in patients initially appearing as
                 at moderate or low risk to assure that no unstable
                 patients are discharged. All patients should be
                 followed up closely until the cardiovascular evaluation
                 is completed and, when possible, a definitive diagnosis

                 been developed from different research groups over the
                 years to study the mechanisms of traumatic brain
                 injury. These models can vary substantially in model
                 features and parameters, making it important to
                 evaluate whether simulation results from one model are
                 readily comparable with another, and whether
                 response-based injury thresholds established from a
                 specific model can be generalized when a different
                 model is employed. The purpose of this study is to
                 parametrically compare regional brain mechanical
                 responses from three validated head FE models to test
                 the hypothesis that regional brain responses are
                 dependent on the specific head model employed as well
                 as the region of interest (ROI). The Dartmouth Scaled
                 and Normalized Model (DSNM), the Simulated Injury
                 Monitor (SIMon), and the Wayne State University Head
                 Injury Model (WSUHIM) were selected for comparisons.
                 For model input, 144 unique kinematic conditions were
                 created to represent the range of head impacts
                 sustained by male collegiate hockey players during
                 play. These impacts encompass the 50th, 95th, and 99th
                 percentile peak linear and rotational accelerations at
                 16 impact locations around the head. Five mechanical
                 variables (strain, strain rate, strain Ã— strain rate,
                 stress, and pressure) in seven ROIs reported from the
                 FE models were compared using Generalized Estimating
                 Equation statistical models. Highly significant
                 differences existed among FE models for nearly all
                 output variables and ROIs. The WSUHIM produced
                 substantially higher peak values for almost all output
                 variables regardless of the ROI compared to the DSNM
                 and SIMon models (p &lt; 0.05). DSNM also produced
                 significantly different stress and pressure compared
                 with SIMon for all ROIs (p &lt; 0.05), but such
                 differences were not consistent across ROIs for other
                 variables. Regardless of FE model, most output
                 variables were highly correlated with linear and
                 rotational peak accelerations. The significant
                 disparities in regional brain responses across head
                 models regardless of the output variables strongly
                 suggest that model-predicted brain responses from one
                 study should not be extended to other studies in which
                 a different model is utilized. Consequently,
                 response-based injury tolerance thresholds from a
                 specific model should not be generalized to other
                 studies either in which a different model is used.
                 However, the similar relationships between regional
                 responses and the linear/rotational peak accelerations
                 suggest that each FE model can be used independently to
                 assess regional brain responses to impact simulations
                 in order to perform statistical correlations with
                 medical images and/or well-selected experiments with
                 documented injury findings.",

                 of subspace preconditioned LSQR (SP-LSQR) to the study

                 assumed that the heart was static during the cardiac
                 cycle; consequently, a time-dependent geometrical error
                 was thought to be unavoidably introduced. In this
                 paper, cardiac motion is included in solutions to the
                 electrocardiographic inverse problem. Cardiac dynamics
                 are simulated based on a previously developed
                 biventricular model that coupled the electrical and
                 mechanical properties of the heart, and simulated the
                 ventricular wall motion and deformation. In the forward
                 computation, the heart surface source model method is
                 employed to calculate the epicardial potentials from
                 the action potentials, and then, the simulated
                 epicardial potentials are used to calculate body
                 surface potentials. With the inclusion of cardiac
                 motion, the calculated body surface potentials are more
                 reasonable than those in the case of static assumption.
                 In the epicardial potential-based inverse studies, the
                 Tikhonov regularization method is used to handle
                 ill-posedness of the ECG inverse problem. The
                 simulation results demonstrate that the solutions
                 obtained from both the static ECG inverse problem and
                 the dynamic ECG inverse problem approaches are
                 approximately the same during the QRS complex period,
                 due to the minimal deformation of the heart in this
                 period. However, with the most obvious deformation
                 occurring during the ST-T segment, the static
                 assumption of heart always generates something akin to
                 geometry noise in the ECG inverse problem causing the
                 inverse solutions to have large errors. This study
                 suggests that the inclusion of cardiac motion in
                 solving the ECG inverse problem can lead to more

                 understand the relationship between subendocardial
                 ischaemia and the resulting epicardial potential
                 distributions. The cardiac tissue is represented by the
                 bidomain model where tissue anisotropy and fiber
                 rotation have been incorporated with a view to
                 predicting the epicardial surface potential
                 distribution. The source of electric potential in this
                 steady-state problem is the difference between plateau
                 potentials in normal and ischaemic tissue, where it is
                 assumed that ischaemic tissue has a lower plateau
                 potential. Simulations with tissue anisotropy and no
                 fiber rotation are also considered. Simulations are
                 performed for various thicknesses of the transition
                 region between normal and ischaemic tissue and for
                 various sizes of the ischaemic region. The simulated
                 epicardial potential distributions, based on an
                 anisotropic model of the cardiac tissue, show that
                 there are large potential gradients above the border of
                 the ischaemic region and that there are dips in the
                 potential distribution above the region of ischaemia.
                 It could be concluded from the simulations that it
                 would be possible to predict the region of
                 subendocardial ischaemia from the epicardial potential
                 distribution, a conclusion contrary to observed
                 experimental data. Possible reasons for this
                 discrepancy are discussed. In the interests of
                 mathematical simplicity, isotropic models of the
                 cardiac tissue are also considered, but results from
                 these simulations predict epicardial potential
                 distributions vastly different from experimental
                 observations. A major conclusion from this work is that
                 tissue anisotropy and fiber rotation must be included
                 to obtain meaningful and realistic epicardial potential

                 The study was motivated by the large variation in

                 bidomain conductivity data sets is chosen. Here, the

                 constitutes one form of the inverse problem of
                 electrocardiography. An often-used approach to
                 overcoming the ill-posed nature of the inverse problem
                 and stabilizing the solution is via zero-order Tikhonov
                 regularization, where the squared norms of both the
                 surface potential residual and the solution are
                 minimized, with a relative weight determined by a
                 so-called regularization parameter. This paper looks at
                 the composite residual and smoothing operator (CRESO)
                 and L-curve methods currently used to determine a
                 suitable value for this regularization parameter, t,
                 and proposes a third method that works just as well and
                 is much simpler to compute. This new zero-crossing
                 method selects t such that the squared norm of the
                 surface potential residual is equal to t times the
                 squared norm of the solution. Its performance was
                 compared with those of the other two methods, using
                 three stimulation protocols of increasing complexity.
                 The first of these protocols involved a concentric
                 spheres model for the heart and torso and three current
                 dipoles placed inside the inner sphere as the source
                 distribution. The second replaced the spheres with
                 realistic epicardial and torso geometries, while
                 keeping the three-dipole source configuration. The
                 final simulation kept the realistic epicardial and
                 torso geometries, but used epicardial potential
                 distributions corresponding to both normal and ectopic
                 activation of the heart as the source model. Inverse
                 solutions were computed in the presence of both
                 geometry noise, involving assumed erroneous shifts in
                 the heart position, and of Gaussian measurement noise
                 added to the torso surface potentials. It was verified
                 that in an idealistic situation, in which correlated
                 geometry noise dominated the uncorrelated Gaussian
                 measurement noise, only the CRESO approach arrived at a
                 value for t. Both L-curve and zero-crossing approaches
                 did not work. Once measurement noise dominated geometry
                 noise, all three approaches resulted in comparable t
                 values. It was also shown, however, that often under
                 low measurement noise conditions none of the three
                 resulted in an optimum solution.",

                 electrocardiography can be characterized by an inverse

                 estimates of heart surface potential distributions in
                 terms of torso potentials through an inverse procedure.
                 First, we outline an automatic adaptive refinement
                 algorithm that minimizes the spatial discretization
                 error in the transfer matrix, increasing the accuracy
                 of the inverse solution. Second, we introduce a new
                 local regularization procedure, which works by
                 partitioning the global transfer matrix into
                 sub-matrices, allowing for varying amounts of
                 smoothing. Each submatrix represents a region within
                 the underlying geometric model in which regularization
                 can be specifically &apos;tuned&apos; using an a priori
                 scheme based on the L-curve method. This local
                 regularization method can provide a substantial
                 increase in accuracy compared to global regularization
                 schemes. Within this context of local regularization,
                 we show that a generalized version of the singular
                 value decomposition (GSVD) can further improve the
                 accuracy of ECG inverse solutions compared to standard
                 SVD and Tikhonov approaches. We conclude with specific

                 liver, kidneys, bone, cartilage, and spleen. Cardiac
                 electrical sources were derived from realistic atrial
                 and ventricular simulations. The conductivity rankings
                 were based on one of two methods: First, we considered
                 fixed percental conductivity changes to probe the
                 sensitivity of the ECG regarding conductivity
                 alterations. Second, we set conductivities to the
                 reported minimum and maximum values to evaluate the
                 effects of the existing conductivity uncertainties. The
                 amplitudes of both atrial and ventricular ECGs were
                 most sensitive for blood, skeletal muscle conductivity

                 signal morphology was considered, fat was more
                 important whereas skeletal muscle was less important.
                 When comparing atria and ventricles, the lungs had a
                 larger effect on the atria yet the heart conductivity
                 had a stronger impact on the ventricles. The effects of

                 three-dimensional finite element model results in a
                 physiological pattern of cardiac contraction. We
                 assumed that the delay between depolarization for all
                 myocytes and the onset of crossbridge formation was
                 constant. Two simulations were performed, one in which
                 contraction was initiated according to the regular
                 depolarization pattern (NORM simulation), and another
                 in which contraction was initiated after synchronous
                 depolarization (SYNC simulation). In the NORM
                 simulation propagation of depolarization was
                 physiological, but wall strain was unphysiologically

                 unphysiological synchronous depolarization (SYNC)
                 myofiber strain was more homogeneous and more

                 formation results in an unrealistic contraction
                 pattern. The present finding may indicate that
                 electromechanical delay times are heterogeneously
                 distributed, such that a contraction in a normal heart

                 asynchronous depolarization and more inhomogeneous
                 contraction than in the normal heart. We investigated
                 whether the increased inhomogeneity in the left

                 mathematical model of cardiac electromechanics,

                 properties. Simulations of a normal heartbeat and of
                 pacing at the right ventricular apex (RVA) were
                 performed. All properties in the two simulations were
                 equal, except for the depolarization sequence.
                 Simulation results of RVA pacing on local
                 depolarization time and systolic midwall
                 circumferential strain were compared with those
                 measured in dogs, using an epicardial sock electrode
                 and MRI tagging, respectively. We used the same methods
                 for data processing for simulation and experiment.
                 Model and experiment agreed in the following aspects.
                 1) Ventricular pacing decreased systolic pressure and
                 ejection fraction relative to natural sinus rhythm. 2)
                 Shortening during ejection and stroke work declined in
                 early depolarized regions and increased in late
                 depolarized regions. 3) The relation between epicardial
                 depolarization time and systolic midwall
                 circumferential strain was linear and similar for the
                 simulation (slope = -3.80 +/- 0.28 s(-1), R2 = 0.87)
                 and the experiments [slopes for 3 animals -2.62 +/-
                 0.43 s(-1) (R2 = 0.59), -2.97 +/- 0.38 s(-1) (R2 =
                 0.69), and -4.44 +/- 0.51 s(-1) (R2 = 0.76)]. We
                 conclude that our model of electromechanics is suitable
                 to simulate ventricular pacing and that the apparently
                 complex events observed during pacing are caused by

                 It is now recognized that a low-risk group can be

                 electrocardiograms and evaluation of cardiac-injury
                 markers. Patients with positive evaluations are

                 homogeneous torso served as the reference against which
                 we compared simulations with a single organ or tissue
                 and assigned its nominal conductivity, or 2) a fully
                 inhomogeneous torso served as the reference and we
                 removed the effect of individual organs or tissues by
                 assigning it the homogeneous conductivity value. When
                 single inhomogeneities were added to an otherwise
                 homogeneous isotropic model, anisotropic skeletal
                 muscle (at a 15:1 anisotropy ratio) and the right and
                 left lung had larger average effects (12.8, 12.7, and
                 12.1\% relative error (RE), respectively) than the
                 other inhomogeneities tested. Our results for removing
                 single inhomogeneities show that the subcutaneous fat,
                 the anisotropic skeletal muscle (with the degree of
                 anisotropy equal to 7:1), and the lungs have larger
                 average impacts on the body surface potential
                 distributions than other elements of the model (with
                 values of 14.9, 12.6, and 11.7\% RE, respectively). The
                 results also show that the size of the effect depended
                 strongly on the distribution of epicardial potentials.
                 The results of this study suggest that accurate
                 representation of tissue inhomogeneity has a
                 significant effect on the accuracy of the forward
                 solution, with regions near the torso surface playing a
                 larger role, in general, than those near the heart.",

                 department patients with possible myocardial ischemia
                 is problematic. Two-dimensional echocardiography has a
                 high sensitivity for identifying patients with
                 myocardial infarction (MI); however, few studies have
                 investigated its diagnostic ability when used acutely
                 in ED patients with possible myocardial ischemia.
                 Therefore we investigated the ability of ED
                 echocardiography for predicting cardiac events in
                 patients with possible myocardial ischemia. Methods:
                 Echocardiography was performed within 4 hours of ED
                 presentation in 260 patients with possible myocardial
                 ischemia, and was considered positive if there were
                 segmental wall motion abnormalities or the ejection
                 fraction was less than 40\%. ECGs were considered
                 abnormal if there was an ST-segment elevation or
                 depression of greater than or equal to 1 mm, or
                 ischemic T-wave inversion. Cardiac events included MI
                 and revascularization. Results: Of the 260 patients
                 studied, 45 had cardiac events (23 MI, 19 percutaneous
                 transluminal angioplasty, 3 coronary bypass surgery).
                 The sensitivity of echocardiography for predicting
                 cardiac events was 91\% (95\% confidence interval 79\%
                 to 97\%]), which was significantly higher than the ECG
                 (40\% [95\% CI 27\% to 55\%]; P&lt;.0001), although
                 specificity was lower (75\% [95\% CI 69\% to 81\%]
                 versus 94\% [95\% CI 90\% to 97\%]; P&lt;.001).
                 Addition of the echocardiography results to baseline
                 clinical variables and the ECG added significant
                 incremental diagnostic value (P&lt;.0001). With use of
                 multivariate analysis, only male gender (P&lt;.03, odds
                 ratio [OR] 2.4 [1.1 to 5.3]), and a positive
                 echocardiographic finding (P&lt;.0001, OR 24 [9 to 65])
                 predicted cardiac events. Excluding patients with
                 abnormal ECGs (N=30) did not affect sensitivity (85\%)
                 or specificity (74\%) of echocardiography. Conclusion:
                 Echocardiography performed in ED patients with possible
                 myocardial ischemia identifies those who will have
                 cardiac events, is more sensitive than the ECG, and has
                 significant incremental value when added to baseline
                 clinical variables and the ECG. [Kontos MC, Arrowood

                 (AMI) is necessary to initiate appropriate treatment.
                 In patients presenting without ST-segment elevation,
                 diagnosis is often dependent on the presence of
                 elevated myocardial markers. This study examines the
                 ability of serial MB mass alone and in combination with
                 myoglobin in diagnosing AMI in patients without
                 ST-segment elevation within 3 hours of presentation. In
                 all, 2,093 patients were admitted and underwent serial
                 marker analysis using myoglobin, creatine kinase (CK),
                 and CK-MB at 0, 3, 6, and 8 hours. AMI was diagnosed by
                 a CK-MB &gt; or =8.0 ng/ml and a relative index (RI)
                 (CK-MB x 100/total CK) &gt; or =4.0. A total of 186
                 patients (9\%) were diagnosed with AMI. The optimal
                 diagnostic strategy was an elevated CK-MB + RI on the
                 initial or 3-hour sample or at least a twofold increase
                 in CK-MB without exceeding the upper range of normal
                 over the 3-hour time period (sensitivity 93\%,
                 specificity 98\%). The combination of an elevated CK-MB
                 + RI or myoglobin on the initial or 3-hour sample had a
                 sensitivity of 94\%, although specificity was
                 significantly lower, at 86\%. Sensitivities and
                 specificities after exclusion of the 242 patients with
                 ischemic electrocardiographic changes were essentially
                 unchanged. We conclude that most patients with AMI
                 presenting with nondiagnostic electrocardiograms can be

                 deformation and structure is critical for clinical
                 diagnosis. However, much about the genesis of
                 deformation and structure is unknown. In the present
                 computational model study, we hypothesize that
                 myofibers locally adapt their orientation to achieve
                 minimal fiber-cross fiber shear strain during the
                 cardiac cycle. This hypothesis was tested in a 3D
                 finite element model of left ventricular (LV) mechanics
                 by computation of tissue deformations and subsequent
                 adaptation of initial myofiber orientations towards
                 those in the deformed tissue. As a consequence of
                 adaptation, local tissue peak stress, strain during

                 increase by at least 10\%, as well as to become 50\%

                 may play a role in atrial arrhythmogenesis through
                 mechanoelectric feedback. In experimental studies,
                 conduction slowing and block have been observed in
                 acutely dilated atria. In the present study, the
                 influence of the stretch-activated current (I(sac)) on
                 impulse propagation is investigated by means of
                 computer simulations. Homogeneous and inhomogeneous
                 atrial tissues are modeled by cardiac fibers composed
                 of segments that are electrically and mechanically
                 coupled. Active force is related to free Ca(2+)
                 concentration and sarcomere length. Simulations of
                 homogeneous and inhomogeneous cardiac fibers have been
                 performed to quantify the relation between conduction
                 velocity and I(sac) under stretch. In our model,
                 conduction slowing and block are related to the amount
                 of stretch and are enhanced by contraction of
                 early-activated segments. Conduction block can be
                 unidirectional in an inhomogeneous fiber and is
                 promoted by a shorter stimulation interval. Slowing of
                 conduction is explained by inactivation of Na(+)
                 channels and a lower maximum upstroke velocity due to a
                 depolarized resting membrane potential. Conduction
                 block at shorter stimulation intervals is explained by
                 a longer effective refractory period under stretch. Our
                 observations are in agreement with experimental results
                 and explain the large differences in intra-atrial
                 conduction, as well as the increased inducibility of

                 earliest recorded activation at NL-B (n = 20), at ABN
                 (n = 8), or at both sites (n = 12). NL-B recordings
                 displayed prolonged low-amplitude secondary plateaus,
                 which were termed &quot;border zone early
                 afterdepolarizations.&quot; These were coincident with
                 the plateaus of the prolonged action potentials in ABN
                 and appeared to be due to electrotonic transmission of
                 current from ABN to NL-B. Border zone TAs arose from
                 these low-amplitude plateaus and were either eliminated
                 by the addition of lidocaine to NL consistent with
                 their presumed NL site of origin or occurred after
                 localized withdrawal of EDTA from one segment in fibers
                 rendered quiescent at the plateau by generalized
                 superfusion with EDTA. In conclusion, APD and membrane
                 potential inhomogeneities lead to electrotonic
                 transmission of injury current to border zones adjacent
                 to zones of abnormal APD prolongation. This injury
                 current leads to TAs originating at the border zone.
                 These findings may be relevant to the role of injury
                 current in clinical arrhythmias.",

To increase the clinical potential of electrophysiological (EP) sim- ulation for the study of cardiac phenomena and the planning of in- terventions, accurate personalization of the fibers is a necessary yet challenging task. Due to the difficulties associated with the in vivo imaging of cardiac fiber structure, researchers have developed al- ternative techniques to personalize fibers. Thus far, cardiac sim- ulation was performed mainly based on rule-based fiber models. More recently, there has been a significant interest in data-driven and statistically derived fiber models. In particular, our predictive method in [1] allows us to estimate the unknown subject-specific fiber orientation based on the more easily available shape informa- tion. The aim of this work is to estimate the effect of using such statistical predictive models for the estimation of cardiac electrical activation times and patterns. To this end, we perform EP simu- lations based on a database of ten canine ex vivo diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) datasets that include normal and failing cases. To assess the strength of the fiber models under varying conditions, we consider both sinus rhythm and biventricular pacing simulations. The results show that 1) the statistically derived fibers improve the estimation of the local activation times by an average of 53.7\% over traditional rule-based models, and that 2) the obtained electrical activations are consistently similar to those of the DTI-based fibers.",

                 technique was developed to explain the results. To
                 produce ischemia in different territories of the

                 descending coronary artery and left circumflex coronary
                 artery were partially constricted in sequence. Results
                 from 36 sheep and the computer simulation are reported.
                 The distributions of epicardial potentials from either

                 elevation was directly associated with the region of
                 reduced blood flow. Insulating the heart from the

                 bidomain model reproduced the epicardial ST patterns
                 and suggested that the ST depression was generated at
                 the lateral boundary between ischemic and normal
                 territories. ST depression on the epicardium reflected
                 the position of this lateral boundary. The boundaries
                 of ischemic territories are shared, and only those
                 appearing on the free wall contribute to external ST
                 potential fields. These effects explain why body
                 surface ST depression does not localize cardiac
                 ischemia in humans.

                 determine how perturbations influenced the tendency for
                 the cells to undergo spontaneous depolarization
                 (automaticity) during 20min of acute ischemia.Methods:
                 A modified Luoâ€“Rudy 1 cell model was used. Since the
                 range of biological variation and measurement errors is
                 largely unknown, we conducted our study of the
                 consequences of perturbations under the assumption that
                 cell model parameters have a normal distribution with a
                 10\% standard deviation. A total of 10000 random cell
                 realizations were tested while varying important
                 Luoâ€“Rudy cell model parameters. Ischemia was modelled
                 by deterministic functions chosen for the expected
                 values of crucial ion concentrations and gating
                 parameters as they developed with time, while realizing
                 the respective parameter values from static normal
                 distributions with a 10\% standard deviation.Results
                 and conclusion: It was found that the tendency towards
                 automaticity did increase as the stochastic parameters
                 were varied. In particular, cells with standard
                 Luoâ€“Rudy parameter values did not become automatic
                 during ischemia, whereas a significant portion of the
                 cells with randomized parameter values did. The
                 relative importance of model parameter variations was
                 also determined and a sodium m-gate activation
                 parameter was identified as the most critical
                 parameter. The frequency of arrhythmic events during
                 acute ischemia is known to be bell-shaped, with a peak
                 at around 7â€“8min after the onset of ischemia. Our
                 simulations display a similar peak in the frequency of
                 automaticity.",

                 throughout the entire volume of the ventricular
                 myocardium. The spatio-temporal coherence of the
                 ventricular excitation process has been utilized to
                 derive the activation time from the estimated time
                 course of the equivalent current density. In the
                 present study, we explored four different linear
                 inverse algorithms (the minimum norm and weighted
                 minimum norm estimates in combination with two
                 regularization schemes: the instant-by-instant
                 regularization and the isotropy method) to estimate the
                 current density at each time instant during the
                 ventricular depolarization. The activation time at any
                 given location within the ventricular myocardium was
                 determined as the time point with the occurrence of the
                 maximum local current density estimate. Computer
                 simulations were performed to evaluate this approach
                 using single- and dual-site pacing protocols in a
                 physiologically realistic cellular automaton heart
                 model. The performance and stability of the proposed
                 approach was evaluated with respect to the various
                 levels of measurement noise (0, 5, 10, 20, 40, and 60
                 muV), the various numbers of ECG electrodes and the
                 modeling errors on the torso geometry and heart
                 position. The simulation results demonstrate that: 1)
                 the single-site paced 3-D activation sequence can be
                 well reconstructed from 200-channel body surface
                 potential maps with additive Gaussian white noise of 20
                 muV (correlation coefficient = 0.90, relative error =
                 0.19, and localization error = 5.49 mm); 2) a higher
                 imaging accuracy can be obtained when the activation is
                 initiated from the left/right ventricle (LV/RV)
                 compared to from the septum; 3) the isotropy method
                 gives rise to a better performance than the
                 conventional instant-by-instant regularization; 4) a
                 decreased imaging accuracy results from a larger nois-
                 - e level, a fewer number of electrodes, or the volume
                 conductor modeling errors; however, a reasonable
                 imaging accuracy can still be obtained with a 60 muV
                 noise level, 64 electrodes, or mild errors on both the
                 torso geometry and heart position, respectively; 5) the

                 when the two sites are paced either simultaneously or
                 with a time delay of 20 ms; 6) two pacing sites can be

In this paper, a statistical atlas of this cardiac fiber architecture is built for the first time using human datasets. This atlas provides an average description of the human cardiac fiber architecture along with its variability within the population. In this study, the population is composed of ten healthy human hearts whose cardiac fiber architecture is imaged ex vivo with DT-MRI acquisitions. The atlas construction is based on a computational framework that minimizes user interactions and combines most recent advances in image analysis: graph cuts for segmentation, symmetric log-domain diffeomorphic demons for registration, and log-Euclidean metric for diffusion tensor processing and statistical analysis. Results show that the helix angle of the average fiber orientation is highly correlated to the transmural depth and ranges from -41° on the epicardium to +66° on the endocardium. Moreover, we find that the fiber orientation dispersion across the population (±13°) is lower than for the laminar sheets (±31°) . This study, based on human hearts, extends previous studies on other mammals with concurring conclusions and provides a description of the cardiac fiber architecture more specific to human and better suited for clinical applications. Indeed, this statistical atlas can help to improve the computational models used for radio-frequency ablation, cardiac resynchronization therapy, surgical ventricular restoration, or diagnosis and followups of heart diseases due to fiber architecture anomalies.",

Yet, its inter-subject variability and more particularly, its relationship to the shape of the myocardium, is not fully understood. In this paper, we extend the statistical analysis of cardiac fiber architecture beyond its description with a fixed average geometry. We study the co-variation of fiber architecture with either shape or strain-based information by exploring their principal modes of joint variations. We apply our general framework to a dataset of 8 ex vivo canine hearts, and find that strain-based information appears to correlate best with the fiber architecture. Furthermore, compared to current approaches that warp an average atlas to the patient geometry, our preliminary results show that joint statistics improves fiber synthesis from shape by 8.0\%, with cases up to 25.9\%. Our experiments also reveal evidence on a possible relation between architectural variability and myocardial thickness.",

  abstract =     "Despite many years of study, certain aspects of
                 myocardial ischemia remain incompletely understood. One
                 observation that motivated this study is that acute,
                 complete occlusion produces elevations but never
                 depression of the ST-segment potentials in
                 electrocardiographic leads over the ischemic zone.
                 Limited flow, on the other hand, leads to ST-segment
                 depression, both in in situ experiments and during
                 clinical stress tests. The prevailing biophysical
                 theory of ischemia suggests that complete occlusion
                 should produce at least transient ST-segment
                 depression, a finding we have neither observed in our
                 own studies nor uncovered in the literature. Our goal
                 with these experiments was to understand the difference
                 between complete occlusion and reduced coronary flow,
                 specifically the behavior at the transition between the
                 two. We have performed experiments by using isolated
                 dog hearts with a cannulated left anterior descending
                 artery suspended in a human shaped electrolytic tank.
                 To create a range of ischemic conditions, we changed
                 coronary flow rates both suddenly and in controlled
                 sequences and varied the heart rate of the isolated
                 heart. The main finding was that in the isolated heart
                 preparation, epicardial ST-segment depression over the
                 ischemic zone arose only under conditions of combined
                 restricted flow and elevated heart rate. Reduced
                 coronary flow alone never produced ST-segment
                 depression. These findings suggest that heart rate and
                 probably metabolic work create the conditions necessary
                 for subendocardial ischemia that reduced flow alone
                 cannot provoke. They furthermore suggest that the
                 degree of ST-segment depression for a given restriction
                 in coronary flow may depend on heart rate, which
                 supports the notion of rate correction for clinical
                 stress electrocardiogram testing.",

                 A realistic three-dimensional model of the ventricles,

                 although variations in ST segments form the predominant
                 basis for diagnostic and monitoring of patients. This
                 incomplete knowledge certainly plays a role in the poor
                 performance of some forms of electrocardiogram-based
                 detection and characterization of ischemia, especially
                 when it is limited to the subendocardium. The focus of
                 our recent studies has been to develop a comprehensive
                 mechanistic model of the electrocardiographic effects
                 of ischemia. The computational component of this model
                 is based on highly realistic heart geometry with
                 anisotropic fiber structure and allows us to assign
                 ischemic action potentials to contiguous regions that
                 can span a prescribed thickness of the ventricles. A
                 separate, high-resolution model of myocardial tissue
                 provides us with a means of setting electrical
                 characteristics of the heart, including the status of
                 gap junctional coupling between cells. The experimental
                 counterpart of this model consists of dog hearts,
                 either in situ or isolated and perfused with blood, in
                 which we control coronary blood flow by means of a
                 cannula and blood pump. By reducing blood flow through
                 the cannula for various durations, we can replicate any
                 phase of ischemia from hyper acute to early infarction.
                 Based on the results of these models, there is emerging
                 a mechanism of the electrocardiographic response to
                 ischemia that depends strongly on the anisotropic
                 conductivity of the myocardium. Ischemic injury
                 currents flow across the boundary between healthy and
                 ischemic tissue, but it is their interaction with local
                 fiber orientation and the associated conductivity that
                 generates secondary currents that determine epicardial
                 ST-segment potentials. Results from experiments support
                 qualitatively the findings of the simulations and

                 simulated values of ST shift) for a parameter
                 identification problem to locate the ischemic region.
                 We then formulate a more flexible representation of the

                 set of ECG data generated by the Bidomain model using
                 the cell model of Winslow et al. Based on this data, we
                 show that values of ST shift recorded at the body

                 localizing acute ischemia in patients undergoing
                 percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA).
                 PTCA balloon inflations produce complete occlusion and
                 acute transient ischemia, which can be detected
                 electrocardiographically with BSPM. Comparisons between
                 maps recorded both during and before the inflation of
                 the PTCA balloon allow patient- and artery-specific
                 characterizations of the resulting ischemia. Knowledge
                 of the patient&apos;s coronary anatomy and the location
                 of the occlusion site by coronary angiography permit an
                 estimation based on cardiac hemodynamics of the region

                 transient ischemia produced by PTCA. To validate the
                 procedure, we compared the locations of predicted

                 haemodynamic, metabolic and electrophysiological
                 consequences of acute coronary artery ligation in an
                 experimental model which allows the simultaneous
                 assessment of blood flow and sampling of blood from
                 both normal and acutely ischaemic zones of myocardium.
                 1. Using local coronary venous sampling, it has been
                 observed that the major metabolic changes which occur
                 in the ischaemic zone during the first 30 min after
                 coronary artery ligation are increases in PCO2,
                 decreases in pH and oxygen content, a shift in lactate
                 handling from extraction to production and an efflux of
                 K+. These changes were not observed in coronary sinus
                 blood draining essentially nonischaemic zones of
                 myocardium. 2. The major haemodynamic change produced
                 by coronary artery ligation was cardiac depression
                 (decreased stroke volume and cardiac work), unchanged
                 LV dP/dt with an elevated filling pressure. 3. Acute
                 ligation of the anterior descending branch of the left
                 coronary artery, l.a.d., resulted in bursts of
                 ventricular ectopic activity which was especially
                 marked 10-20 min after ligation and which frequently
                 resulted in ventricular fibrillation. The incidence of
                 arrhythmias could be modified by the species of dog
                 used, the anaesthetic employed, the arterial oxygen
                 tension and the administration of several
                 antiarrhythmic drugs. The possible relevance observed
                 in the ischaemic myocardium, to the genesis of these
                 arrhythmias is discussed. 4. The changes in the
                 ST-segment of epicardial leads produced by short (3
                 min) occlusions of the l.a.d. were studied in mongrel
                 dogs. Evidence is presented which suggests that the
                 evolution of ST-segment elevation is linked to the
                 efflux of K+ from ischaemic myocardial cells.",

                 infarction (AMI) by a 12-lead electrocardiogram has
                 poor sensitivity and specificity and, therefore, relies
                 on biochemical markers of myocardial necrosis, which
                 can only be reliably detected within 14 to 16 hours
                 from symptom onset. The body surface map (BSM) improves
                 AMI detection but is limited by its interpretation by
                 inexperienced medical staff. To facilitate
                 interpretation, an automated BSM algorithm was
                 developed and is evaluated in this study. One hundred
                 three patients with ischemic-type chest pain were
                 recruited for this study from December 2001 to April
                 2002. A 12-lead electrocardiogram (Marquette Mac 5K)
                 and BSM (PRIME-ECG) were recorded at initial
                 presentation, and cardiac troponin I and/or creatine
                 kinase-MB levels measured at 12 hours after symptom
                 onset. The admitting physician&apos;s 12-lead
                 electrocardiographic (ECG) interpretation, 12-lead ECG
                 algorithm (Marquette 12 SL V233) diagnosis, and BSM
                 algorithm diagnosis were documented for each patient.
                 AMI, defined by elevation of troponin I to &gt;1
                 microg/L and/or creatine kinase-MB to &gt;25U/L,
                 occurred in 53 patients. The admitting physician
                 diagnosed 24 patients with AMI (sensitivity 45\%,
                 specificity 94\%), the 12-lead ECG algorithm diagnosed
                 17 patients with AMI (sensitivity 32\%, specificity
                 98\%), and the BSM algorithm diagnosed 34 patients with
                 AMI (sensitivity 64\%, specificity 94\%). The BSM
                 algorithm improved the diagnostic sensitivity by 2.0 (p
                 &lt;0.001) and 1.4 (p = 0.002) compared with the
                 12-lead ECG algorithm or the admitting physician,
                 respectively. There was no significant difference in
                 specificity. Thus, the BSM algorithm improves detection
                 of AMI compared with the 12-lead ECG algorithm or
                 physician&apos;s 12-lead ECG interpretation.",

                 DESIGN:Observational and case-control
                 study.SETTING:Data were analyzed from a multicenter
                 study of coronary care unit admitting practices that
                 included patients who presented to the ED with chest
                 pain or other symptoms suggestive of acute cardiac
                 ischemia (N = 5,773). Patients with missed AMI (cases)
                 were compared with control patients admitted with AMI
                 and to a second control group of patients discharged
                 without AMI.RESULTS:Of 1,050 patients with AMI, 20
                 (1.9\%; 95\% confidence interval, 1.2-2.9\%) were not
                 admitted. Patients with missed AMI were significantly
                 less likely to have ECG changes and a history of AMI or
                 nitroglycerin use than patients admitted with AMI.
                 However, they were significantly more likely to have
                 ECG changes than patients discharged without AMI. Five
                 patients with missed AMI (25\%) had ST-segment
                 elevation, and seven (35\%) were discharged with a
                 diagnosis of ischemic heart disease by the physician in
                 the ED. Death or potentially lethal complications
                 occurred in 25\% of missed AMI patients.CONCLUSION:The
                 rate of missed AMI in the ED was only 1.9\%. However,
                 25\% of these might have been prevented had
                 ST-elevation not been missed, and another 25\% might
                 have been prevented had patients who were recognized to
                 have ischemic heart disease by the physician in the ED

                 source model is compared with a bidomain-theory-based
                 transmembrane potential source formulation. The
                 epicardial source approach is extended to the whole
                 heart surface including the endocardial surfaces. We
                 introduce the concept of the numerical null and signal
                 space to draw attention to the problems associated with
                 the nonuniqueness of the inverse solution and show that
                 reconstruction of null-space components is an important
                 issue for physiologically meaningful inverse solutions.
                 Both formulations were tested with simulated data
                 generated with an anisotropic heart model and with
                 clinically measured data of two patients. A linear and

                 applied for reconstructions of the epicardial and
                 transmembrane potential, respectively. A direct
                 comparison of both formulations was performed in terms
                 of computed activation times. We found the

                 strategy for sampling and meshing multimaterial volumes

                 variations in the magnitude of ST-segment depression

                 constriction. Electrograms from the epicardial surface,

                 Regional blood flow to the outer and inner layers of
                 the myocardium was measured by means of a
                 heat-clearance method. With the application of a
                 coronary constriction, myocardial blood flow to the
                 inner layer began to decrease with a 75\% coronary
                 constriction, while flow to the outer layer was
                 maintained at near normal up to least an 80\% coronary
                 constriction. Non-linear squares curve of between
                 ST-elevation and the decrease in myocardial flow
                 resulted in y = 18.80 exp-0.06x - 0.02 in the outer
                 layer and y = 9.22 exp-0.02x - 1.54 in the inner layer.
                 Also the non-linear squares curve of between epicardial
                 ST-elevation and the decrease in myocardial flow
                 resulted in y = 50.91 exp-0.11 x + 0.04 in the inner

                 solving the nonlinear inverse ill-posed problem
                 employing spatio-temporal regularization. Four
                 different reference AT maps (sinus rhythm,
                 right-ventricular and septal pacing, accessory pathway)
                 were calculated with a bidomain theory based
                 anisotropic finite-element heart model in combination
                 with a cellular automaton. In this heart model a
                 realistic fiber architecture and conduction system was
                 implemented. Although the anisotropy has some effects
                 on forward solutions, effects on inverse solutions are
                 small indicating that cardiac anisotropy might be
                 negligible for some clinical applications (e.g.,
                 imaging of focal events) of our AT imaging approach.
                 The main characteristic events of the AT maps were

                 physiopathology of ventricular arrhythmias varies with
                 its timing, there being three main phases: early, late
                 and chronic. The early phase covers the first 30
                 minutes and is dominated by tachycardias and
                 fibrillations resulting from multiple micro-reentry
                 circuits which are the consequence of major changes in
                 conduction and excitability created by acute ischaemia.
                 These arrhythmias may be triggered by extrasystoles
                 which have a different mechanism related to the injury
                 current generated in the border zone between ischaemic
                 and healthy cells. The late phase lasts about 72 hours:
                 it is characterised by polymorphic ventricular
                 extrasystoles and bursts of relatively slow ventricular
                 tachycardia. Much more rapid tachycardia can be induced
                 by stimulation. The origin of these arrhythmias is
                 usually in the surviving Purkinje fibres of the
                 subendocardium. The mechanisms are variable: abnormal
                 automaticity, reentry or activity triggered by delayed
                 after depolarisations. During the chronic phase,
                 reentrant tachycardia is possible but only when induced
                 by stimulation. Delayed conduction is the consequence
                 of non-uniform antisotropism related to the
                 disorientation of the myocardial fibres caused by
                 fibrosis. In the clinical situation, most research has
                 been centered on sustained monomorphic ventricular
                 tachycardias of the chronic phase. Their mechanism is
                 almost exclusively reentry (the circuits usually being
                 located in the subendocardium) as suggested by the
                 triggering and interruption of clinical tachycardias by
                 stimulation, the recording of fragmented activation or
                 prepotentials at the site of emergence of the

                 means to estimate field values between measured sites.
                 A specific example is the measurement of the electrical
                 activity of the heart, either on its surface or within
                 the muscle, a technique known as cardiac mapping, which
                 is widely used in research. While three-dimensional
                 measurement of cardiac fields by means of
                 multielectrode needles is relatively common, the
                 interpolation methods used to analyze these
                 measurements have rarely been studied systematically.
                 The present study addressed this need by applying three
                 trivariate techniques to cardiac mapping and evaluating
                 their accuracy in estimating activation times at
                 unmeasured locations. The techniques were
                 tetrahedron-based linear interpolation, Hardy&apos;s

                 spacings typical in cardiac mapping (1 cm),

                 reconstruction of field details. This paper provides

                 equations to compute the transmembrane potential

                 formulate it in terms of an output least squares

                 subject to suitable PDE constraints. The problem is
                 highly unstable and, even under optimal recording
                 conditions, it does not have a unique solution. We
                 propose a methodology for stabilizing and enforcing

                 the human heart. This leads to a severely ill posed

                 in body position. We prospectively analyzed the
                 influence of spontaneous temporal variation (technical
                 and biological noise) and changes in body position on
                 the ST segment (ST-vector magnitude [ST-VM]) during
                 cVST of 21 healthy human subjects. The 95\% expectancy
                 range of the spontaneous intraindividual ST-VM
                 variation was found to be +/-8 @mV for the error of

                 as good reproducibility. Moreover, the present findings
                 support currently used ST-VM ischemia criteria.
                 However, the impact of positional changes on ST-VM
                 seems to be of importance (with the possibility of

                 isolated canine heart perfused with Tyrode&apos;s

                 current was reflected in the ST shift of the orthogonal
                 electrocardiogram, derived from the surface of a cubic
                 container in which the heart was placed. After
                 measurement of the ST vector with different K+
                 concentrations, the heart has fixed with formalin and
                 the injury zone was delineated with serial sections.
                 The boundaries of the selectively perfused region were

                 concentrations, the ST shift became more marked.
                 However, it was saturated at about 30 mEq/L K+. The
                 maximum injury current, calculated from the saturated
                 value of the ST magnitude, amounted to 0.10 mA.cm per

                 directions to make the border along and across the long
                 axis of the papillary muscle. The results indicate that

                 Fifteen (71\%) and 6 (29\%) subjects had significant
                 positional QRS-VD and STC-VM changes, respectively.
                 Vectorcardiography changes were most frequent and
                 pronounced in the left lateral position. An alternative
                 to the existing criterion of ischemia is proposed to

                 seems to have a significant potential of continuous

                 body position change or even an algorithm enabling
                 on-line correction for positional vectorcardiography

                 models testing ST-elevation criteria with QRST
                 variables and compare their performance with the
                 80-lead body surface map (BSM) in detection of acute
                 myocardial infarction (AMI). Because the prevalence of
                 non-ST-elevation AMI is increasing worldwide, advances
                 in early ECG detection of AMI are urgently needed. The
                 study population was 755 consecutive patients
                 presenting with ischemic chest pain from January 2002
                 to June 2004. All patients had electrocardiography and
                 body surface mapping performed at initial presentation.
                 AMI occurred in 519 patients (69\%, cardiac troponin T
                 or I level &gt; or =0.1 ng/ml). Of these 519 patients,
                 303 (58\%) had no ST-elevation on the initial 12-lead
                 electrocardiogram. Ten patients were classified as
                 having an &quot;aborted AMI&quot; and were included in
                 the AMI analysis. The American College of
                 Cardiology/European Society of Cardiology criteria for
                 ST-elevation on 12-lead electrocardiogram identified
                 236 patients with AMI (sensitivity 45\%, specificity
                 92\%). Additional QRST features improved sensitivity
                 (51\% to 68\%) but with decreased specificity (71\% to
                 89\%), with the optimal multivariate ECG model having a
                 c-statistic of 0.75. The optimal BSM model identified
                 402 patients as having AMI (sensitivity 76\%,
                 specificity 92\%, c-statistic 0.84). This improvement
                 in sensitivity over the 12-lead electrocardiogram was
                 due mainly to detection of ST-elevation in the high
                 right anterior, posterior, and right ventricular
                 territories and AMI in the presence of left bundle
                 branch block. In conclusion, QRST variables added to
                 criteria for ST-elevation result in improvement in
                 sensitivity of the 12-lead electrocardiogram, although
                 with decreased specificity. The BSM is superior in
                 detecting AMI and demonstrates the importance of
                 electroanatomic evaluation of patients with acute
                 coronary syndromes.",

                 junctions to yield fast and realistic electrical
                 activation of the ventricles. A patient-specific
                 biventricular geometry is obtained from processing
                 computed tomography scan data. A one-manifold
                 implementation of the fast marching method based on
                 Eikonal-type equations is used for modeling heart
                 electrophysiology, which facilitates the multiscale
                 1-D-3-D coupling at very low computational costs. The

                 partial-thickness or &quot;subendocardial&quot; MI.
                 Experimental studies have shown either ST elevation or
                 depression in leads overlying a subendocardial ischemic
                 region. Those reporting elevation have shown depression
                 over the lateral borders of the ischemia. Simulation
                 studies with anisotropic models have explained the
                 ST-elevation results. Presently, while experimentalists
                 may have difficulty understanding the ST elevation,
                 most model studies fail to explain ST depression in
                 overlying leads during partial-thickness ischemia. We
                 have simulated partial-thickness ischemia in a
                 3-dimensional model of the human heart. Our results

                 anisotropy ratios can all have a decisive influence on
                 the sign of the ST deviation. We hypothesize that ST
                 depression in leads overlying an ischemic zone is due
                 to subendocardial ischemia in tissue where a

  abstract =     "Myocardial ischemia leads to an efflux of potassium
                 ions from affected cells. The resulting depolarization
                 of the resting membrane is one of the main features of
                 ischemic myocardium. It has been shown experimentally
                 that a part of the surplus interstitial potassium is
                 transported out of the ischemic zone, even if no
                 coronary blood flow is present in the affected area. We
                 propose to model this transport mechanism
                 mathematically with a diffusion equation. This model
                 explains the measured spatial profiles of extracellular
                 potential and potassium concentration. In addition, it
                 allows a quantitative prediction of the transmembrane
                 current that flows as a result of ischemia-induced
                 depolarization. This current is thought to play a role
                 in arrhythmogenicity, which is an important cause of
                 mortality in acute myocardial infarction. Our model
                 predicts that this current reaches its maximum exactly
                 on the border of the hypoxic area. An important
                 depolarizing current would be present just within the
                 border, where hypoxia is accompanied by a resting
                 membrane potential that is only slightly elevated, due
                 to coupling with the adjacent normal tissue. Still, in
                 the presence of potassium transport the predicted
                 current density is not large enough to explain ectopic
                 activation on the lateral border of the ischemia. This
                 suggests that activation is more likely to occur at the
                 endocardium, where the potassium gradient is steeper.",

                 depression. A similar pattern can occur in unstable
                 angina. Current textbooks consider ST depression as a

                 dramatic increase in computer power over the last few
                 years broke the ground for the construction of
                 anatomically realistic models of the heart at an
                 unprecedented level of detail. To effectively make use
                 of high-resolution imaging datasets for modeling
                 purposes, the imaged objects have to be discretized.
                 This procedure is trivial for structured grids.
                 However, to develop generally applicable heart models,
                 unstructured grids are much preferable. In this study,
                 a novel image-based unstructured mesh generation
                 technique is proposed. It uses the dual mesh of an
                 octree applied directly to segmented 3-D image stacks.
                 The method produces conformal, boundary-fitted, and
                 hexahedra-dominant meshes. The algorithm operates fully
                 automatically with no requirements for interactivity
                 and generates accurate volume-preserving
                 representations of arbitrarily complex geometries with
                 smooth surfaces. The method is very well suited for
                 cardiac electrophysiological simulations. In the
                 myocardium, the algorithm minimizes variations in
                 element size, whereas in the surrounding medium, the
                 element size is grown larger with the distance to the
                 myocardial surfaces to reduce the computational burden.
                 The numerical feasibility of the approach is
                 demonstrated by discretizing and solving the monodomain
                 and bidomain equations on the generated grids for two

                 propagation of electrical waves and contraction in
                 ventricles of the heart is anisotropy of cardiac
                 tissue. Anisotropy is determined by orientation of
                 myocardial fibres. Determining fibre orientation field
                 and shape of the heart is important for anatomically
                 accurate modelling of electrical and mechanical
                 function of the heart. The aim of this paper is to
                 introduce a theoretical rule-based model for anatomy
                 and fibre orientation of the left ventricle (LV) of the
                 heart and to compare it with experimental data. We
                 suggest explicit analytical formulae that allow us to
                 obtain the left ventricle form and its fibre direction
                 field. The ventricle band concept of cardiac
                 architecture given by Torrent-Guasp is chosen as the
                 model postulate.METHODS:In our approach, anisotropy of
                 the heart is derived from some general principles. The
                 LV is considered as a set of identical spiral surfaces,
                 each of which can be produced from the other by
                 rotation around one vertical axis. Each spiral surface
                 is filled with non-intersecting curves which represent
                 myocardial fibres.For model verification, we use
                 experimental data on fibre orientation in human and
                 canine hearts.RESULTS:LV shape and anisotropy are
                 represented by explicit analytical expressions in a
                 curvilinear 3-D coordinate system. The derived fibre
                 orientation field shows good qualitative agreement with
                 experimental data. The model reveals the most thorough
                 quantitative simulation of fibre angles at the LV
                 middle zone.CONCLUSIONS:Our analysis shows that the
                 band concept can generate realistic anisotropy of the
                 LV. Our model shows good qualitative agreement between
                 the simulated fibre orientation field and the
                 experimental data on LV anisotropy, and the model can
                 be used for various numerical simulations to study the
                 effects of anisotropy on cardiac excitation and
                 mechanical function.",

                 the forward problem, a coupled cellular model of
                 cardiac excitation-contraction is embedded within an
                 anatomically realistic model of the cardiac ventricles,
                 which is itself embedded within a torso model. This
                 continuum modelling framework allows the effects of
                 cellular-level activity on the surface
                 electrocardiogram (ECG) to be carefully examined.
                 Furthermore, the contributions of contraction and local
                 ischemia on body surface recordings can also be
                 elucidated. Such information can provide theoretical
                 limits to the sensitivity and ultimately the detection
                 capability of body surface ECG recordings. Despite
                 being very useful, such detailed forward modelling is
                 not directly applicable when seeking to use densely
                 sampled ECG information to assess a patient in a
                 clinical environment (the inverse problem). In such a
                 situation patient specific models must be constructed
                 and, due to the nature of the inverse problem, the
                 level of detail that can be reliably reproduced is
                 limited. Extensive simulation studies have shown that
                 the accuracy with which the heart is localised within
                 the torso is the primary limiting factor. To further
                 identify the practical performance capabilities of the
                 current inverse algorithms, high quality experimental
                 data is urgently needed. We have been working towards
                 such an objective with a number of groups, including
                 our local hospital in Auckland. At that hospital, in
                 patients undergoing catheter ablation surgery, up to
                 256 simultaneous body surface signals were recorded by
                 using various catheter pacing protocols. The geometric
                 information required to customize the heart and torso
                 model was obtained using a combination of ultrasound
                 and laser scanning technologies. Our initial results
                 indicate that such geometric imaging modalities are
                 sufficient to produce promising inversely-constructed
                 activation profiles.

                 improves. Cardiovascular disease remains the leading
                 cause of death for adults in the United States, and
                 with continually increasing trends such as obesity and
                 diabetes, will likely remain so in the future. With the
                 introduction of improved therapies, the numbers of
                 patients dying after their first myocardial infarction
                 continues to decline. Electrocardiogram (ECG)
                 technology has improved, and further research has
                 improved its sensitivity and specificity allowing for
                 earlier, more consistent diagnosis of ACS. As a result,
                 guidelines have been developed to assist nurses and
                 clinicians in the management of patients with ACS.
                 Nurses are in a unique position to provide primary
                 triage, recognize ACS based on the patient&apos;s
                 presentation and initial 12-lead ECG, and initiate an
                 appropriate response. Key elements of 12-lead ECG
                 interpretation and their application to established
                 guidelines are essential skills for nurses working in
                 clinical arenas frequented by patients with ACS.",

                 body surface potential maps (BSPMs). The heart lies in

                 inhomogeneous torso, homogeneous torso, and a torso
                 with stylized lungs (to generate an approximate model).
                 The inhomogeneous model was used to compute BSPMs from
                 the measured epicardial potentials. These BSPMs were
                 the starting point for inverse computations in the
                 different torso models. Epicardial potential maps,
                 EGMs, and isochrones were computed. The homogeneous

                 potential reconstructions than the inhomogeneous model

                 patterns, EGMs, isochrones, and locations of pacing
                 sites were reconstructed with comparable accuracy when
                 torso inhomogeneities were ignored.The results

                 ischaemia preparation to study the relation between
                 ischaemic zone size and the incidence of ischaemia
                 induced and reperfusion induced arrhythmias, to test
                 the hypothesis that arrhythmias are initiated by flow
                 of injury current between the ischaemic zone and the
                 uninvolved myocardium. The new model was used to
                 examine whether injury current suppression is involved
                 in the mechanism of action of a new antiarrhythmic
                 intervention, substitution of chloride anion by
                 nitrate.Isolated perfused (Langendorff mode) rat hearts
                 (n = 12 per group) were subjected to 30 min global or
                 regional ischaemia. Ventricular arrhythmia incidence
                 during ischaemia and during reperfusion were related to
                 the size of the involved region. The modified model of
                 global ischaemia employed right intra-atrial
                 superfusion to maintain normal sinus rate and 1:1
                 atrioventricular (AV) conduction.Sham ligation, low
                 left coronary ligation, high left coronary ligation,
                 and global ischaemia produced, as a percentage of total
                 ventricular weight, 0\%, 21.0(SEM 0.8)\%, 47.0(1.0)\%,
                 and 100\% regions of ischaemia (occluded zones). Heart
                 rates were similar in each group and AV block did not
                 occur. The incidences of ischaemia induced ventricular
                 fibrillation (VF) were 0, 17, 75, and 17\% with
                 increasing occluded zone sizes. Incidences of
                 reperfusion induced VF were 0, 8, 92, and 92\%
                 respectively. The antiarrhythmic action of substitution
                 of extracellular chloride by nitrate, previously shown
                 using models of regional ischaemia, was confirmed in
                 the modified global ischaemia model.These findings
                 strongly support the theory that current of injury
                 between ischaemia and adjacent non-ischaemic zones is
                 necessary for initiation of ischaemia induced VF, since
                 susceptibility was maximal when ischaemic and
                 uninvolved regions were equivalent in size (and the
                 scope for injury current was maximal) whereas
                 susceptibility was negligible when scope was minimal.
                 In contrast, reperfusion induced VF appears to depend
                 only on the presence and amount of reperfused tissue,
                 indicating that flow of injury current between involved
                 and uninvolved tissue is unnecessary for its
                 initiation. Discrimination of the mechanism of action
                 of antiarrhythmic interventions may be possible since
                 drugs effective solely via amelioration of flow of
                 injury current (or incrementation of collateral flow)
                 will not influence arrhythmias in this model.
                 Modification of injury current and collateral flow do
                 not appear to contribute to the antiarrhythmic action
                 of substitution of extracellular chloride by nitrate.",

                 mechanics show that fiber stress depends heavily on the
                 choice of muscle fiber orientation in the wall. This
                 finding brought us to the hypothesis that fiber
                 orientation may be such that mechanical load in the
                 wall is homogeneous. Aim of this study was to use the
                 hypothesis to compute a distribution of fiber
                 orientation within the wall. In a finite element model
                 of LV wall mechanics, fiber stresses and strains were
                 calculated at beginning of ejection (BE). Local fiber
                 orientation was quantified by helix (HA) and transverse
                 (TA) fiber angles using a coordinate system with local
                 r-, c-, and l-directions perpendicular to the wall,
                 along the circumference and along the meridian,
                 respectively. The angle between the c-direction and the
                 projection of the fiber direction on the cl-plane (HA)
                 varied linearly with transmural position in the wall.
                 The angle between the c-direction and the projection of
                 the fiber direction on the cr-plane (TA) was zero at
                 the epicardial and endocardial surfaces. Midwall TA
                 increased with distance from the equator. Fiber
                 orientation was optimized so that fiber strains at BE
                 were as homogeneous as possible. By optimization with
                 TA = 0 degree, HA was found to vary from 81.0 degrees
                 at the endocardium to -35.8 degrees at the epicardium.
                 Inclusion of TA in the optimization changed these
                 angles to respectively 90.1 degrees and -48.2 degrees
                 while maximum TA was 15.3 degrees. Then the standard
                 deviation of fiber strain (epsilon f) at BE decreased
                 from +/- 12.5\% of mean epsilon f to +/- 9.5\%. The
                 root mean square (RMS) difference between computed HA
                 and experimental data reported in literature was 15.0
                 degrees compared to an RMS difference of 11.6 degrees
                 for a linear regression line through the latter data.",

                 be distributed uniformly over the cardiac walls during
                 the ejection period of the cardiac cycle. Mathematical
                 models of left ventricular (LV) wall mechanics have
                 shown that the distribution of fiber strain during
                 ejection is sensitive to the orientation of muscle
                 fibers in the wall. In the present study, we tested the
                 hypothesis that fiber orientation in the LV wall is
                 such that fiber strain during ejection is as
                 homogeneous as possible. A finite-element model of LV
                 wall mechanics was set up to compute the distribution
                 of fiber strain at the beginning (BE) and end (EE) of
                 the ejection period of the cardiac cycle, with respect
                 to a middiastolic reference state. The distribution of
                 fiber orientation over the LV wall, quantified by three
                 parameters, was systematically varied to minimize
                 regional differences in fiber shortening during
                 ejection and in the average of fiber strain at BE and
                 EE. A well-defined optimum in the distribution of fiber
                 orientation was found which was not significantly
                 different from anatomical measurements. After
                 optimization, the average of fiber strain at BE and EE
                 was 0.025 +/-0.011 (mean+/-standard deviation) and the
                 difference in fiber strain during ejection was
                 0.214+/-0.018. The results indicate that the LV
                 structure is designed for maximum homogeneity of fiber

                 generated by precisely timed opening and closing of ion
                 channels in individual cardiac myocytes. These impulses
                 spread throughout the cardiac muscle to manifest as
                 electrical waves in the whole heart. Regularity of
                 electrical waves is critically important since they
                 signal the heart muscle to contract, driving the
                 primary function of the heart to act as a pump and
                 deliver blood to the brain and vital organs. When
                 electrical activity goes awry during a cardiac
                 arrhythmia, the pump does not function, the brain does
                 not receive oxygenated blood, and death ensues. For
                 more than 50 years, mathematically based models of
                 cardiac electrical activity have been used to improve
                 understanding of basic mechanisms of normal and

                 about 20\% are subsequently shown to have myocardial
                 infarction. Plasma MB CK is not elevated until 8 to 10
                 hours after onset, and the ECG is unreliable; thus, the

                 unnecessary use of hospital beds, particularly those in
                 the intensive care units, (2) to administer

                 earlier detection of coronary reocclusion and
                 reinfarction. Diagnostic imaging techniques such as
                 pyrophosphate, thallium-201 technetium sestamibi, or
                 positron emitting agents lack the necessary early
                 diagnostic specificity, but echocardiography has
                 potential although its specificity is limited. Plasma
                 CK isoforms provide diagnostic sensitivity and
                 specificity of 96\% and 94\%, respectively, within the
                 initial 4 to 6 hours of onset and can be assayed within
                 minutes. In a prospective study of 1100 patients

                 isoforms, 75\% had infarction and about 50\% were
                 discharged home. A scenario for the future might be to
                 initiate thrombolytic therapy outside the hospital (eg,
                 recombinant tissue-type plasminogen activator [r-TPA]
                 20 mg bolus) and upon arrival, confirm or exclude

                 ischemia, the obstruction of coronary flow leads to the
                 interruption of oxygen flow, glucose, and washout in
                 the affected tissue. Cellular metabolism is impaired

                 elevated within 20 to 30 seconds after the onset of
                 acute coronary occlusion and, when persistent, such
                 changes offer a possible indirect marker of the extent
                 and severity of myocardial ischemic injury and of
                 eventual cell death. When ST-segment elevation on the
                 epicardial ECG is measured 15 minutes after an acute
                 coronary occlusion in the dog, a general correlation
                 exists with biochemical changes, regional myocardial
                 blood flow, and myocardial electrolyte alterations
                 measured at 15 minutes, although when an effort is made
                 to correlate the degree of such alterations with the
                 magnitude of the ST-segment change there is
                 considerable scatter. On the other hand, when the
                 ST-segment elevation at 15 minutes is correlated with
                 myocardial blood flow, histologic changes, and creating
                 phosphokinase (CPK) depletion 24 hours later, the
                 correlation is good. Possible mechanisms underlying
                 ST-segment elevation are discussed, and data are
                 reviewed which indicate that the epicardial ECG my be
                 relatively insentive to subendocardial injury; in the
                 experimental setting this problem may be partially
                 corrected by the use of intramyocardial ECG leads. The
                 extension of direct epicardial ECG maps to precordial
                 ST-segment mapping poses additional problems that
                 include reduced sensitively, problems due to reciprocal
                 changes in the ECG at the body surface, surface contact
                 of the electrodes, pericarditis, and individual
                 variability in the rate of spontaneous regression of
                 ST-segment changes. Such mapping appears reliable only
                 for infarctions of the anterior and lacteral wall.
                 Further research is necessary on analysis of the QRS
                 complex, and use of vector leads. Despite these
                 problems experimental and clinical studies indicate
                 that precordial electrocardiographic analysis may be
                 useful for detecting acute changes in the severity of
                 ischemic injury over relatively short periods of time
                 (2 to 4 hours). This indirect measure clearly will
                 require correlation with specific markers of ischemic
                 damage, but with further improvements it seems likely
                 that analysis of serial ECG changes will evolve into a
                 valuable and reliable nonivasive clinical tool for
                 characterizing myocardial ischemia and infarction.",

                 regional information about intracardiac electrical
                 events from electrical measurements on the body
                 surface. The choice of epicardial potentials as the
                 solution to the inverse problem is motivated by the
                 availability of a unique epicardial potential solution
                 for each body surface potential distribution, by the
                 ability to verify experimentally the inverse-recovered
                 epicardial potentials, by the proven relationship
                 between epicardial potentials and the details of
                 intracardiac regional events, and by the possibility of
                 using the inverse solution as a supplement or possible
                 replacement to clinical epicardial potential mapping
                 prior to surgical intervention. Although, in principle,
                 the epicardial potential distribution can be recovered
                 from the body surface potential distribution, the
                 inverse problem in terms of potentials is ill-posed,
                 and naive attempts to reconstruct the epicardial
                 potentials result in incorrect solutions which are
                 highly oscillatory. Large deviations from the actual
                 solution may result from inaccuracy of the data
                 measurement, incomplete knowledge of the potential data
                 over the entire torso, and inaccurate description of
                 the inhomogeneous torso volume conductor. This review
                 begins with a mathematical and qualitative description
                 of the inverse problem in terms of epicardial
                 potentials. The ill-posed nature of the problem is
                 demonstrated using a theoretical boundary value
                 problem. Effects of inaccuracies in the body surface
                 potential data (stability estimates) are introduced,
                 and a sensitivity analysis of geometrical and
                 inhomogeneity parameters is presented using an
                 analytical eccentric spheres model. Various
                 computational methods for relating epicardial to body
                 surface potentials, i.e., the computation of the
                 forward transfer matrix, are described and compared.
                 The need for regularization of the inverse recovery of
                 epicardial potentials, resulting from the need to
                 invert the ill-conditioned transfer matrix, is
                 demonstrated. Several regularization techniques are
                 compared in terms of their performance regarding noise
                 in the data and inaccuracies in geometry and
                 inhomogeneities. Finally, several existing, regularized
                 inverse procedures that compute epicardial potentials
                 from measured body surface potential data are
                 introduced and compared. The review concludes with a
                 section that points toward future directions for
                 improving the quality of the inverse-reconstructed
                 epicardial potentials. Future directions for the use of
                 the inverse problem to obtain epicardial potential

                 for solving the inverse problem of locating ischemic
                 regions in the heart. The electrical activity in the
                 human heart is modeled by the bidomain equations, which
                 can be expanded to compute the potentials on the body
                 surface. The associated inverse problem is to use ECG
                 recordings to gain information about ischemias. We
                 propose an algorithm for doing this, combining the
                 level set method with a simpler minimization problem.
                 Instead of trying to determine the shape, as in the
                 level set method, we simply make the approximation that
                 the ischemia is spherical. The effects of ischemia on
                 the electrical attributes of heart tissue are examined.
                 The new method is tested with computer simulations on
                 synthetic body surface potential maps (BSPMs) in a
                 realistic geometry, using realistic values for the
                 parameters. It is shown to be, in some respects,
                 superior to the level set approach and may be a step
                 toward a practical algorithm useful in medical
                 diagnostics.

                 electrophysiological properties of cells, tissues, and
                 organs. Commonly, the modeling is based on
                 Maxwell&apos;s and Poisson&apos;s equations for
                 electromagnetic and electric fields, respectively, and

                 such as the finite element and finite differences
                 methods. Focus of this work are finite element methods,
                 which are based on an element-wise discretization of
                 the spatial domain. These methods can be classified on
                 the element&apos;s geometry, e.g. triangles,
                 tetrahedrons and hexahedrons, and the underlying
                 interpolation functions, e.g. polynomials of various

                 made in the field of cardiac MRI, and cardiac MRI can
                 provide accurate evaluation of myocardial ischemia and
                 infarction (MI). Late gadolinium (Gd)-enhanced MRI can
                 clearly delineate subendocardial infarction, and the
                 assessment of transmural extent of infarction on late
                 enhanced MRI has been shown to be useful in predicting
                 functional recovery of dysfunctional myocardium in
                 patients after MI. Stress first-pass contrast-enhanced
                 (CE) myocardial perfusion MRI can be used to detect
                 subendocardial ischemia, and recent studies have
                 demonstrated the high diagnostic accuracy of stress
                 myocardial perfusion MRI for detecting significant
                 coronary artery disease (CAD). Free-breathing,
                 whole-heart coronary MR angiography (MRA) was recently
                 introduced as a method that can provide visualization
                 of all three major coronary arteries within a single
                 three-dimensional (3D) acquisition. With further
                 improvements in MRI techniques and the establishment of
                 a standardized study protocol, cardiac MRI will play a
                 pivotal role in managing patients with ischemic heart

                 primary acute ischemic injury to myocardium in a live
                 animal. In vitro, guinea pig platelets were sensitive
                 to perturbation and aggregation by a suspension of
                 ultrafine fibrillary collagen material isolated from
                 the aorta of an aged burro (Equus asinus). The
                 platelets responded to the stimulatory action of this
                 material down to 100 to 200 ng (dry weight) added to
                 0.45 ml of platelet-rich plasma, as determined by
                 aggregometric technique. Aortic fibrillary collagen
                 material injected IV into guinea pigs (350 to 1900
                 microgram protein/kg of weight) produced a transitory
                 disappearance of virtually all circulating platelets
                 within 5 minutes. In animals in which blood samples
                 were taken 2.5 hours after injection, 50 to 75\% of the
                 average base-line platelets in the circulation of
                 controls returned to the circulation. In other
                 experiments, 3 anesthetized animals were injected by
                 jugular vein with an amount of active fibrillary
                 collagen material (300 microgram as protein/kg of
                 animal weight) estimated to produce reversible platelet
                 aggregation in vivo. Two control animals were injected
                 with the same dose of the material that had been
                 inactivated (15 minutes at 100 C) to abolish platelet
                 aggregation. Treated and control animals were
                 maintained under general anesthesia for 2.5 hours.
                 Intraventricular pressures and electrocardiographs
                 (ECG) were monitored continuously for the first 30
                 minutes. The injection of the active fibrillary
                 collagen material caused a large ventricular pressure
                 elevation (170/10, 180/10, and 150/10 mm of Hg) in
                 approximately 40 s. Preinfusion ventricular pressures
                 in the 3 animals were 65/0, 85/5, and 88/0 mm of Hg,
                 respectively. Within 60 s, there was a reduction in the
                 absolute platelet number in the peripheral circulation.
                 The elevation of ventricular pressure persisted for
                 approximately 5 minutes and was followed within 30
                 minutes by a set of ECG events suggestive of acute
                 myocardial ischemic injury, which included premature
                 ventricular contractions, transient S-T segment
                 depression concurrent with ventricular hypertension,
                 and S-T segment elevation with reversed tall upright
                 T-waves in association with a decrease to the
                 preinfusion ventricular base line. Other ECG changes
                 included prolongation of the P-R segment, missed
                 ventricular contractions, and arrhythmia. The ECG
                 changes seemed to be subsequent to platelet
                 microthrombus formation in the pulmonary arterial
                 microcirculation. By 2.5 hours after the treatment,
                 platelets &quot;rebounded&quot; into the circulation in
                 2 surviving guinea pigs, and left ventricular pressures
                 and ECG profiles returned to the preinfusion base
                 lines. Guinea pigs IV infused with similar amounts of
                 inactivated (15 minutes at 100 C) fibrillary collagen
                 material did not show changes.",

                 problem-driven visualization research, yet there is
                 little guidance available about how to do them
                 effectively. In this paper we reflect on our combined
                 experience of conducting twenty-one design studies, as
                 well as reading and reviewing many more, and on an
                 extensive literature review of other field work methods
                 and methodologies. Based on this foundation we provide
                 definitions, propose a methodological framework, and
                 provide practical guidance for conducting design
                 studies. We define a design study as a project in which
                 visualization researchers analyze a specific real-world
                 problem faced by domain experts, design a visualization
                 system that supports solving this problem, validate the
                 design, and reflect about lessons learned in order to
                 refine visualization design guidelines. We characterize
                 two axes - a task clarity axis from fuzzy to crisp and
                 an information location axis from the domain
                 expert&apos;s head to the computer - and use these axes
                 to reason about design study contributions, their
                 suitability, and uniqueness from other approaches. The
                 proposed methodological framework consists of 9 stages:
                 learn, winnow, cast, discover, design, implement,
                 deploy, reflect, and write. For each stage we provide
                 practical guidance and outline potential pitfalls. We
                 also conducted an extensive literature survey of
                 related methodological approaches that involve a
                 significant amount of qualitative field work, and
                 compare design study methodology to that of
                 ethnography, grounded theory, and action research. View

                 significant effects of respiration, heart rate and
                 changes in time during myocardial ischemia. Regional
                 epicardial R waves showed a transient increase in
                 amplitude following coronary narrowing. There was no
                 loss of electrically active myocardium following 15 min
                 of ischemia. Irreversible loss of R waves were noted at
                 between 30 and 45 min and progressed to full
                 development within 5 h following coronary artery
                 narrowing. The loss of electrically active myocardium
                 (R loss plus Q waves) at 5 h was closely related to the
                 myocardial depletion of creatine kinase activity (mu/mg
                 DNA-1) at 24 h in each dog. The early manifestation of

                 single tool usable by both clinicians and reviewers of
                 care. Over a two-year period, the authors prospectively
                 collected data on 5,773 emergency room patients seen in
                 six New England hospitals for symptoms suggesting acute
                 cardiac ischemia. In the Developmental Phase, based on
                 3,453 such patients seen during the first year, the
                 authors developed a logistic regression-based TIPI for
                 acute cardiac ischemia. Using seven clinical features
                 reliably ascertainable both in the emergency room
                 setting and by medical record review, the TIPI
                 expressed a patient&apos;s probability of having acute
                 ischemia as between 0-100\%. In this phase, a risk
                 category system based on the TIPI scale was also
                 devised, which created four similar-sized groups, by
                 cutting at 10\%, 25\%, and 55\%. In the Test Phase,
                 when prospectively tested on the 2,320 emergency room
                 patients seen during the second year, the TIPI showed
                 excellent diagnostic performance. Its
                 receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) curve area of
                 0.88 was comparable to the original predictive
                 instrument and the ROC curve path suggested performance
                 comparable to physicians as well. Its slope of the
                 relationship between predicted and observed
                 probabilities of having acute ischemia was 1.11 (R2 =
                 0.97) with a correlation of 0.99 (P less than 0.0001),
                 suggesting excellent calibration of predictions
                 throughout the probability range. For patients who
                 proved to have acute ischemia, the average TIPI
                 probability was 59\%, whereas for those without
                 ischemia, the average TIPI value was 21\% (P less than
                 0.0001). This differentiation was maintained even for
                 those given different (including inappropriate) triage
                 to the CCU, ward, or home (P less than 0.0001 for each
                 disposition). When the performance of the four
                 TIPI-based risk groups was prospectively tested on
                 year-two patients, among the 552 patients in the low
                 probability group, only 1.6\% had acute cardiac
                 ischemia, including only 0.7\% with acute infarctions.
                 Among the 484 patients in the high probability group,
                 81.6\% had acute ischemia, and 53.3\% acute myocardial
                 infarctions, suggesting these to be clinically relevant

                 to reconstruct cardiac electrical sources from body
                 surface potentials and a mathematical model that
                 relates the sources to the measurements. Due to
                 attenuation and smoothing that occurs in the thorax,
                 the inverse ECG problem is ill-posed and imposition of
                 a priori constraints is needed to combat this
                 ill-posedness. When the problem is posed in terms of
                 reconstructing heart surface potentials, solutions have
                 not yet achieved clinical utility; limitations include
                 the limited availability of good a priori information
                 about the solution and the lack of a &quot;good&quot;
                 error metric. We describe an approach that combines
                 body surface measurements and standard forward models
                 with two additional information sources: statistical
                 prior information about epicardial potential
                 distributions and sparse simultaneous measurements of
                 epicardial potentials made with multielectrode coronary
                 venous catheters. We employ a Bayesian methodology
                 which offers a general way to incorporate these
                 information sources and additionally provides
                 statistical performance analysis tools. In a simulation
                 study, we first compare solutions using one or more of
                 these information sources. Then, we study the effects
                 of varying the number of sparse epicardial potential
                 measurements on reconstruction accuracy. To evaluate
                 accuracy, we used the Bayesian error covariance as well
                 as traditional error metrics such as relative error.
                 Our results show that including even sparsely sampled
                 information from coronary venous catheters can
                 substantially improve the reconstruction of epicardial
                 potential distributions and that a Bayesian framework
                 provides a feasible approach to using this information.
                 Moreover, computing the Bayesian error standard
                 deviations offers a means to indicate confidence in the
                 results even in the absence of validation data.",

                 increased risk of sudden death, which may be due in
                 part to a greater vulnerability to severe ventricular
                 arrhythmias. Our objectives were to determine (i)
                 whether pressure overload-induced LV hypertrophy
                 increases susceptibility to ischemia- and/or
                 reperfusion-induced ventricular fibrillation (VF), and
                 (ii) whether any increased susceptibility is mediated
                 by changes intrinsic to the hypertrophied myocardium.
                 LV pressure overload was induced in rats by abdominal
                 aortic constriction (AC), while controls received
                 sham-operations (SH). Three weeks after the operation,
                 LV weight was 44 +/- 3\% greater in AC rats than in SH
                 rats although right ventricle (RV) weights were
                 similar. At this time, isolated hearts (n = 12/group)
                 were subjected to dual coronary perfusion. Alter 15
                 minutes of aerobic perfusion, either the left or right
                 coronary bed (supplying predominantly LV or RV tissue,
                 respectively) was subjected to 7 minutes of zero-flow
                 ischemia and either 5 minutes of reperfusion
                 (reperfusion study) or 40 minutes of sustained ischemia
                 (ischemia study). AC rats exhibited greater
                 susceptibility than SH rats to both ischemia- and
                 reperfusion-induced ventricular fibrillation, but only
                 when the hypertrophied LV was subjected to ischemia.
                 The increased susceptibility to arrhythmias was not
                 entirely due to a larger ischemic zone, indicating that
                 intrinsic changes within hypertrophied myocarium played

                 constitutes one form of inverse problems in
                 electrocardiography (ECG). Since these problems are
                 ill-posed, one approach is to use zero-order Tikhonov
                 regularization, where the squared norms of both the
                 residual and the solution are minimized, with a
                 relative weight determined by the regularization
                 parameter. In this paper, we used three different
                 methods to choose the regularization parameter in the
                 inverse solutions of ECG. The three methods include the
                 L-curve, the generalized cross validation (GCV) and the
                 discrepancy principle (DP). Among them, the GCV method
                 has received less attention in solutions to ECG inverse
                 problems than the other methods. Since the DP approach
                 needs knowledge of norm of noises, we used a model
                 function to estimate the noise. The performance of
                 various methods was compared using a concentric sphere
                 model and a real geometry heart-torso model with a
                 distribution of current dipoles placed inside the heart
                 model as the source. Gaussian measurement noises were
                 added to the body surface potentials. The results show
                 that the three methods all produce good inverse
                 solutions with little noise; but, as the noise
                 increases, the DP approach produces better results than
                 the L-curve and GCV methods, particularly in the real
                 geometry model. Both the GCV and L-curve methods
                 perform well in low to medium noise situations.",

                 an ill-posed inverse problem which generally requires a
                 regularized numerical solution. Two kinds of
                 errors/noise: geometric errors and measurement errors
                 exist in the ECG inverse problem and make the solution
                 of such problem more difficulty. In particular,
                 geometric errors will directly affect the calculation
                 of transfer matrix A in the linear system equation AX =
                 B. In this paper, we have applied the truncated total
                 least squares (TTLS) method to reconstruct EPs from
                 BSPs. This method accounts for the noise/errors on both
                 sides of the system equation and treats geometric
                 errors in a new fashion. The algorithm is tested using
                 a realistically shaped heart-lung-torso model with
                 inhomogeneous conductivities. The h-adaptive boundary
                 element method [h-BEM, a BEM mesh adaptation scheme

                 (adds/removes) grid with fixed order of interpolation
                 function and prescribed numerical accuracy] is used for
                 the forward modeling and the TTLS is applied for
                 inverse solutions and its performance is also compared
                 with conventional regularization approaches such as
                 Tikhonov and truncated single value decomposition
                 (TSVD) with zeroth-, first-, and second-order. The
                 simulation results demonstrate that TTLS can obtain
                 similar results in the situation of measurement noise
                 only but performs better than Tikhonov and TSVD methods
                 where geometric errors are involved, and that the
                 zeroth-order regularization is the optimal choice for
                 the ECG inverse problem. This investigation suggests
                 that TTLS is able to robustly reconstruct EPs from BSPs

  abstract =     "BACKGROUND:Accurate detection of the earliest signs of
                 ischemia on the surface electrocardiogram (ECG) is
                 essential for timely diagnosis and management of
                 potentially life-threatening ischemic events. Yet,
                 accuracy of ischemia analysis in ECG monitors remains
                 suboptimal because of a number of confounding factors,
                 including changes in body position and other artifacts.
                 Hence, the goals of this study were (1) to examine the
                 duration and time course of ischemic events and (2) to
                 compare ECG changes caused by &quot;true&quot; ischemic
                 events with those caused by changes in body position.
                 Continuous, 12-lead Holter ECGs obtained from patients
                 who presented to the emergency department with chest
                 pain and enrolled in the Ischemia Monitoring and
                 Mapping in the Emergency Department in Appropriate
                 Triage and Evaluation of Acute Ischemic Myocardium
                 study were analyzed. Holter recordings were initiated
                 within the first 40 minutes after patients&apos;
                 arrival to the emergency department. Here we present
                 preliminary results.METHODS:Twelve patients (age, 59
                 +/- 16 years; 5 women, 2 with a final diagnosis of
                 non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction, 4 with
                 unstable angina, and 6 with other cardiovascular
                 diseases), in whom ischemic ST deviations were
                 identified on Holter data, underwent 4 consecutive,
                 2-minute recordings in the following body positions:
                 (1) supine, (2) on the left side, (3) on the right
                 side, and (4) sitting (or standing) upright. After
                 baseline correction, beat-to-beat changes in QRS and
                 ST-T segments were examined in all 8 channels and the
                 root-mean-square curve by using an adaptive algorithm
                 that computes the slope, amplitude, duration, area, and
                 the Karhunen-LoÃ¨ve-derived representation of the
                 corresponding segment. To prevent possible biases
                 toward patients with more frequent ischemic events, a
                 single index event was chosen for analysis in each
                 patient. There were 3 ST-elevation events and 9
                 ST-depression events; these events reached the maximum
                 ST deviation 11 +/- 8 hours (mean +/- SD) after the
                 beginning of the recording.RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS:In
                 most patients with transient myocardial ischemia, the
                 microvolt-level, subthreshold deviation of the ST
                 segment developed gradually, over 15 to 20 minutes,
                 until it reached the maximum, superthreshold level.
                 Despite the different ischemia localizations, the
                 root-mean-square curve allowed accurate detection of
                 significant changes in the ST segment in the studied
                 group (Friedman analysis of variance for repeated
                 measurements over a 1-hour interval). Changes in body
                 position could be identified by tracking dynamics of
                 the QRS pattern/axis. Adaptive algorithms for tracking
                 of the ST dynamics with simultaneous tracking of the
                 patterns of QRS complexes to discriminate the true and
                 &quot;false&quot;-positive events are presented and

                 of thrombus, pain relief, and control of injury current
                 in all four patients. Rest angina with concomitant ST
                 and T wave changes occurred in six patients. In two
                 patients symptoms occurred early (within 6 months),
                 whereas angina developed 4 to 10 years after coronary
                 bypass graft surgery in four patients. In the two
                 patients with early recurrence of symptoms suboptimal
                 anastomosis was found in one, while the other patient
                 had a venous valve in the vein graft in conjunction
                 with a stenosis in the native coronary artery. In three
                 of four patients with late recurrence of angina,
                 symptoms developed as a result of atherosclerotic
                 stenosis in their vein grafts; in the fourth patient an
                 occluded graft was found to supply a stenosed native

                 ischemic injury have assumed that transmembrane
                 potential changes are uniform throughout a region of
                 ischemia such that injury currents arise exclusively at
                 the boundary between normal and ischemic myocardium. In
                 such models, the distribution and amplitude of ST
                 segment deflections are considered to arise from a
                 polarized surface interfacing normal and ischemic
                 myocardium. This concept in modeling ischemic injury
                 was derived from the application of principles of
                 electric field theory which had been successfully
                 applied previously to ventricular activation in which
                 QRS potentials are considered to arise from polarized
                 surfaces representing the relatively narrow interfaces
                 between depolarized and nondepolarized myocardium. The
                 present paper outlines the limitations of modeling
                 ischemic injury as a polarized surface in terms of the
                 failure of the predictions of such a model to be
                 supported by the experimentally observed: 1)
                 distribution and relative amplitude of epicardial ST
                 segment elevation overlying a region of ischemia; 2)
                 directional changes in epicardial ST segment elevation
                 that occur with changes in the size of an ischemic
                 region; and 3) nonuniform distribution of transmembrane
                 potential changes which occur within a region of
                 ischemia. A new electrocardiographic model of ischemic
                 injury is formulated which accounts for the nonuniform
                 distribution of transmembrane potential changes which
                 occur throughout a region of ischemia. The model
                 accurately describes experimental observations
                 regarding ST segment deflections which had remained
                 inconsistent with previous models.",

                 the loss of cell-to-cell electrical interaction during
                 ischemia modulates the amplitude of ischemia-induced
                 TQ-segment depression (ie, the injury potential) and
                 the occurrence of ventricular fibrillation (VF) during
                 the so-called Ib phase of ventricular
                 arrhythmias.Regional ischemia was induced by 60 minutes
                 of mid-left anterior descending coronary artery
                 ligation in open-chest swine (n = 10). Cell-to-cell
                 electrical uncoupling was defined as the onset of the
                 terminal rise in whole-tissue resistivity (Rt). Local
                 activation times and TQ-segment changes (injury
                 potential) were determined from unipolar electrograms.
                 Extracellular K+ ([K+]e) and pH (pHe) were measured
                 with plunge-wire ion-selective electrodes. VF occurred
                 in 6 of 10 pigs during regional no-flow ischemia
                 between 19 and 30 minutes after the arrest of
                 perfusion. The occurrence of VF was positively
                 correlated to the onset of cell-to-cell electrical
                 uncoupling (R2 = .885). Cell-to-cell electrical
                 uncoupling superimposed on changes of [K+]e and pHe
                 contributed to the failure of impulse propagation
                 between 19 and 30 minutes after the arrest of
                 perfusion. During ischemia, maximum TQ-segment
                 depression was -10 mV at 19 minutes, after which
                 TQ-segment depression slowly recovered. The onset of
                 the TQ-segment recovery was correlated to the second
                 rise in Rt (R2 = .886).In the regionally ischemic in
                 situ porcine heart, loss of cell-to-cell electrical
                 interaction is related to the occurrence of VF and
                 changes in the amplitude of the injury current.
                 Cellular electrical uncoupling contributes to failure
                 of impulse propagation in the setting of altered tissue
                 excitability as a result of elevated [K+]e and low pHe.
                 These data indicate that Ib arrhythmias and ECG changes
                 during ischemia are influenced by the loss of
                 cell-to-cell electrical interaction.",

                 collocation and Galerkin BEMs in the epicardial
                 potential problem. The integral equations and
                 discretizations were formulated in terms of the single-
                 and double-layer operators. All inner element integrals
                 were calculated analytically. The computational methods
                 were validated against analytical solutions in a
                 simplified geometry. On the basis of the validation, no

                 errors. The LG method also produced the smallest
                 discretization error on the epicardial surface. In the
                 inverse computation of epicardial potential, the
                 electrode-specific transfer matrix performed better
                 than the full transfer matrix. The Tikhonov 2
                 regularization outperformed the Tikhonov 0. In the

                 depended on electrode positions and chosen error
                 measure. When large modeling errors such as omission of
                 the lungs were present, the choice of the basis and

                 This assumption causes modeling errors. In this study,

                 the relationship between the heart and body surface

                 cardiac modeling. Based on the histology of cardiac
                 tissue we created a geometrical model at a cellular
                 scale to compute the effective conductivity of a piece
                 of cardiac tissue. In turn, the conductivity values
                 obtained from this cellular scale model were used in a
                 whole heart model in which we simulated regional,
                 subendocardial ischemia. Histological changes at a
                 cellular level led to changes in the effective
                 conductivity tensor of the tissue, which in turn
                 resulted in changes in the epicardial potential
                 patterns during the ST-interval. Two effects were
                 studied using this multi-scale approach: (1) the
                 influence of a dynamically growing ischemic region on
                 the epicardial potentials, and (2) the influence of a
                 dynamically changing conductivity in the ischemic zone
                 due to changes in the underlying pathology. One
                 specific finding was the presence of epicardial
                 patterns consisting of a central elevation and two
                 opposite depressions at the edges of the ischemic zone
                 which rotated as the ischemia became more transmural.
                 In addition, the epicardial potentials decreased in
                 magnitude with the duration of the ischemia due to
                 changes in the effective conductivity of the ischemic

                 its passive electrical conductivity, we created a
                 geometrical model of cardiac tissue on a cellular scale
                 that encompassed myocytes, capillaries, and the
                 interstitial space that surrounds them. A special mesh
                 generator was developed for this model to create
                 realistically shaped myocytes and interstitial space
                 with a controlled degree of variation included in each
                 model. In order to derive the effective conductivities,
                 we used a finite element model to compute the currents
                 flowing through the intracellular and extracellular
                 space due to an externally applied electrical field.
                 The product of these computations were the effective

                 extracellular spaces. The simulations of bi-domain

                 Ischaemic conditions were simulated by model parameters
                 being changed to match the morphological and electrical
                 changes of three phases of ischaemia reported in

                 the interstitial space, cell swelling and the closure
                 of gap junctions. The model contained 64 myocytes
                 described by 2 million tetrahedral elements, to which
                 an external electric field was applied, and then the
                 finite element method was used to compute the
                 associated current density. In the first case, a
                 reduction in the amount of interstitial space led to a
                 reduction in extracellular longitudinal conductivity by
                 about 20\%, which is in the range of reported
                 literature values. Moderate cell swelling in the order

                 during the third phase of ischaemia, a ten fold
                 increase in the gap junction resistance was simulated.

                 provide a reasonable basis for numerical simulations of
                 cardiac electrophysiology. Because of changes occurring
                 in very short time intervals and over small spatial

                 solved on fine computational grids, and small

                 computational challenges that have been addressed by
                 several authors. One popular way of reducing the CPU
                 demands is to approximate the bidomain model by the
                 monodomain model, and thus reducing a two by two set of
                 partial differential equations to one scalar partial

                 bidomain to monodomain computations, using

                 cardiac tissues and boundaries. Because of the complex
                 shape of many biological structures, it is often
                 difficult to create meshes that conform to the
                 boundaries between distinct regions. The resulting
                 meshes can be non-conformal, i.e., they have element
                 faces that do not align with the surface tangents and
                 the elements represent a smooth surface as a jagged
                 boundary. We hypothesize that these jagged,
                 non-conformal meshes produce local concentrations of

                 the resulting potential fields and generate misleading

                 of myocardial fibers, the spread of excitation, and the
                 associated ECG signals is necessary for addressing the
                 forward problem of electrocardiography, that is,
                 predicting intracardiac and extracardiac ECGs from
                 known intracardiac activity. So far, these relations
                 have been studied experimentally only in small
                 myocardial areas. In this study, we tested the
                 hypothesis that potential distributions measured over
                 extensive epicardial regions during paced beats reflect
                 the direction of superficial and intramural fibers
                 through which excitation is spreading in both the
                 initial and later stages of ventricular excitation. We
                 also tried to establish whether the features of the
                 epicardial potential distribution that correlate with
                 fiber direction vary as a function of pacing site,
                 intramural pacing depth, and time elapsed after the
                 stimulus. An additional purpose was to compare measured
                 epicardial potentials with recently published numerical
                 simulations depicting the three-dimensional spread of
                 excitation in the heart muscle and the associated
                 potential fields.The hearts of 18 mongrel dogs were
                 exposed and 182 to 744 unipolar electrograms were
                 recorded from epicardial electrode arrays (2.3 x 3.0 to
                 6.5 x 6.5 cm). Hearts were paced at various intramural
                 depths through an intramural needle. The overall number
                 of pacing sites in 18 dogs was 241. Epicardial
                 potential distributions, electrographic waveforms, and
                 excitation time maps were displayed, and fiber
                 directions in the ventricular wall underlying the
                 electrodes were determined histologically. During the
                 early stages of ventricular excitation, the position of
                 the epicardial maxima and minima revealed the
                 orientation of myocardial fibers near the pacing site
                 in all cases of epicardial and intramural pacing and in
                 60\% of cases of endocardial or subendocardial pacing.
                 During later stages of propagation, the rotation and
                 expansion of the positive areas correlated with the
                 helical spread of excitation through intramurally
                 rotating fibers. Marked asymmetry of potential patterns
                 probably reflected epicardial-endocardial obliqueness
                 of intramural fibers. Multiple maxima appeared in the
                 expanding positive areas.For 93\% of pacing sites,
                 results verified our hypothesis that epicardial
                 potential patterns elicited by ventricular pacing
                 reflect the direction of fibers through which
                 excitation is spreading during both the initial and
                 later stages of propagation. Epicardial potential
                 distributions provided information on the site of
                 origin and subsequent helical spread of excitation in
                 an epicardial-endocardial, endocardial-epicardial, or
                 double direction. Results were in agreement with
                 previously published numerical simulations except for
                 the asymmetry and fragmentation of the positive
                 areas.",

During atrial pacing (normal endocardial to epicardial activation) intramyocardial activation time within the left ventricular free wall between subendocardial and subepicardial plunge electrode terminals, increased from 12.7+/-1.5 ms (control) to 28.2+/-3.2 ms after 3 min ischaemia at the base. At the apex, the activation time increase (over the same distance) was less (19.5+/-2 ms at 3 min ischaemia). This difference in increase in activation time at the base and apex was significant (P<0.05). At the apex the ischaemia induced activation delay occurred primarily over the endocardial half of the wall, whereas the opposite was observed at the base of the heart. Using an epicardial electrode array stimulation along the long axis of the epicardial fibres showed minimal conduction delay during ischaemia whereas stimulation transverse to the epicardial fibres resulted in substantial conduction time prolongation, as was the case with intramural conduction. Intramural conduction during ischaemia was similar in non-infarcted regions of infarcted hearts compared to hearts with no previous MI. To conclude, in patients with coronary artery disease epicardial activation delay early during ischaemia is caused primarily by intramural delay and not by delay along the epicardium. Moreover, the ischaemia-induced transmural activation delay is inhomogeneous.",

                 presenting to the emergency department with chest pain
                 of possible ischemic origin.We conducted an
                 observational study of 1,187 consecutive patients seen
                 in the ED of an urban tertiary care hospital with the
                 chief complaint of chest pain. Within 60 minutes of
                 presentation, each patient was assigned to one of five
                 levels on the basis of his or her risk of myocardial
                 infarction (MI) or unstable angina (UA): level 1, MI;

                 UA; and level 5, noncardiac chest pain. In the lower
                 risk levels (3 and 4), immediate resting myocardial
                 perfusion imaging was used as a risk-stratification
                 tool alone (level 4) or in combination with serial
                 markers (level 3).Acute MI, early revascularization
                 indicative of acute coronary syndrome, or both were

                 revascularization; level 3: 3\% MI, 17\%
                 revascularization; level 4: .7\% MI; 2.5\%
                 revascularization. Sensitivity of immediate resting
                 myocardial perfusion imaging for MI was 100\% (95\%
                 confidence interval [CI], 64\% to 100\%) and
                 specificity 78\% (74\% to 82\%). In patients with

                 significantly higher than in patients with normal
                 imaging findings. During 1-year follow-up, patients
                 with normal imaging findings (n = 338) had an event
                 rate of 3\% (revascularization) with no MI or death
                 (combined events: negative predictive value, 97\%; 95\%
                 CI, 95\% to 98\%). Patients with abnormal imaging
                 findings (n = 100) had a 42\% event rate (combined

                 with 11\% experiencing MI and 8\% cardiac death.This
                 strategy is a safe, effective method for rapid triage
                 of chest pain patients. Rapid perfusion imaging plays a
                 key role in the risk stratification of low-risk

                 detectable within 30 seconds in intracardiac left
                 ventricle (P&lt;0.0016) and right ventricle-coronary
                 sinus (P&lt;0.0011) leads, 60 seconds in coronary sinus
                 leads (P&lt;0.0002), 90 seconds in right ventricle
                 leads (P&lt;0.0020), and 360 seconds in body-surface
                 electrocardiographic signals (P&lt;0.0022).
                 Intracardiac leads exhibited a higher probability of
                 detecting ischemia-induced changes than body-surface
                 leads (P&lt;0.0381), and the right ventricle-coronary
                 sinus configuration provided the highest sensitivity
                 (96\%). The 24-hour ECG recordings showed that the
                 ischemic index is statistically significantly increased
                 compared with baseline in lead I, aVR, and all
                 precordial leads (P&lt;0.0388). Finally, we showed that
                 the ischemic index in intracardiac electrograms is
                 significantly increased preceding ventricular
                 tachyarrhythmic events (P&lt;0.0360).We present a novel
                 method that is capable of detecting ischemia-induced
                 changes in intracardiac electrograms as early as 30
                 seconds following myocardial infarction or as early as
                 12 minutes preceding tachyarrhythmic events.Â© 2014 The

                 is difficult, since the relation between pathology and
                 deformation is not straightforward. Mathematical models
                 of cardiac mechanics could be used to translate

                 between strains in model and experiment are related to
                 the choice of the myofiber orientation in the model. To
                 this end, we measured midwall circumferential strain
                 E(cc) and circumferential-radial shear strain E(cr) in
                 three healthy subjects using MRT. E(cc) as computed in
                 the model agreed well with measured E(cc). Computed
                 E(cr) differed significantly from measured E(cr). The
                 time course of E(cr) was found to be very sensitive to
                 the choice of the myofiber orientation, in particular
                 to the choice of the transverse angle. Discrepancies

                 attempted intracoronary thrombolysis, with emphasis on
                 follow-up. Fifty-nine patients (81\%) had coronary
                 reflow sufficient to control pain and injury current:
                 52 received thrombolysis alone and seven had
                 thrombolysis combined with acute coronary angioplasty.
                 Recurrent ischemic events in hospital were frequent and
                 occurred in 17 patients (29\%). These included silent
                 reocclusion (four patients), recurrent angina (eight
                 patients), and recurrent infarction in the same
                 myocardial zone (five patients). Late ischemic events
                 occurred in 11 patients (19\%) and included silent
                 reocclusion (two patients) and angina (nine patients).
                 Although acute coronary angioplasty resulted in a high
                 rate of successful myocardial reperfusion, long-term
                 vessel patency was infrequent. The results of coronary
                 bypass surgery, performed in hospital for severe
                 residual coronary stenosis and angina and later for
                 recurrent angina, were uniformly good. At follow-up of
                 6 to 36 months (mean 18.5 +/- 8.1), total mortality was
                 five patients (8\%). Only 16 reperfused patients (27\%)
                 were alive and well without recurrent ischemia or
                 interventions. We conclude that reopening an acutely
                 occluded coronary artery by thrombolysis and/or
                 angioplasty can be performed in the majority of
                 patients but must be regarded as initial therapy in
                 view of the high incidence of recurrent ischemic
                 events. Reperfused patients with stable myocardial
                 blood supply post infarction have low long-term

                 border zone) were studied at different times after
                 occlusion of the left anterior coronary artery (LAD).
                 Isolated preparations were superfused in vitro,
                 transmembrane potentials recorded, and impulse
                 propagation mapped. In preparations from subacute
                 infarcts (1 and 5 days), resting potential, action
                 potential amplitude, upstroke velocity, and duration
                 were all significantly reduced. Well-defined
                 directional differences in propagation occurred.
                 Propagation was more rapid in the direction
                 perpendicular to the left anterior coronary artery than
                 in the direction perpendicular to the base of the
                 heart, because of the uniform anisotropic structure of
                 the surviving muscle fibers which were arranged in
                 tightly packed bundles oriented perpendicular to the
                 left anterior coronary artery. The only ultrastructural
                 abnormalities found in these muscle fibers was an
                 accumulation of large amounts of lipid droplets. As the
                 infarcts healed, resting potential, action potential
                 amplitude, and upstroke velocity returned to normal by
                 2 weeks, although action potential duration decreased
                 further. Lipid droplets had disappeared, and connective
                 tissue had invaded the epicardial border zone,
                 separating the muscle bundles. By 2 months, action
                 potentials were normal, but the muscle fibers were
                 widely separated and disoriented by the connective
                 tissue (parallel bundles no longer were found). In
                 these regions with a nonuniform anisotropic structure,
                 the well-defined directional differences in impulse
                 propagation were lost. However, activation was very
                 slow, perhaps because of diminished connections between
                 cells. The persistence of slow conduction in healed
                 infarcts may contribute to the occurrence of chronic

                 models of cardiac structure. We then provide a detailed
                 explanation of a processing pipeline which we have
                 recently developed for constructing realistic
                 computational models of the heart from high resolution
                 structural and diffusion tensor (DT) magnetic resonance
                 (MR) images acquired ex vivo. The presentation of the
                 pipeline incorporates a review of the methodologies
                 that can be used to reconstruct models of cardiac
                 structure. In this pipeline, the structural image is
                 segmented to reconstruct the ventricles, normal
                 myocardium, and infarct. A finite element mesh is
                 generated from the segmented structural image, and
                 fiber orientations are assigned to the elements based
                 on DTMR data. The methods were applied to construct
                 seven different models of healthy and diseased hearts.
                 These models contain millions of elements, with spatial
                 resolutions in the order of hundreds of microns,
                 providing unprecedented detail in the representation of
                 cardiac structure for simulation studies.",

                 was to develop a methodology to estimate cardiac fiber
                 orientations from in vivo images of patient heart
                 geometries. An accurate representation of ventricular
                 geometry and fiber orientations was reconstructed,
                 respectively, from high-resolution ex vivo structural
                 magnetic resonance (MR) and diffusion tensor (DT) MR
                 images of a normal human heart, referred to as the
                 atlas. Ventricular geometry of a patient heart was
                 extracted, via semiautomatic segmentation, from an in
                 vivo computed tomography (CT) image. Using image
                 transformation algorithms, the atlas ventricular
                 geometry was deformed to match that of the patient.
                 Finally, the deformation field was applied to the atlas
                 fiber orientations to obtain an estimate of patient
                 fiber orientations. The accuracy of the fiber estimates
                 was assessed using six normal and three failing canine
                 hearts. The mean absolute difference between
                 inclination angles of acquired and estimated fiber
                 orientations was 15.4Â°. Computational simulations of
                 ventricular activation maps and pseudo-ECGs in sinus

                 ventricular cells. In these cells, early and delayed
                 afterdepolarizations (EADs and DADs) were induced by 1

                 enables a simple construction of the gradient operator
                 (in a matrix form) over irregular meshes, which is
                 often difficult to derive; 2)it achieves consistent

                 potential map. We study how to improve numerical
                 approximation of the inverse problem when the
                 finite-element method is used. Being ill-posed, the
                 inverse problem requires different discretization
                 strategies from its corresponding forward problem. We
                 propose refinement guidelines that specifically address
                 the ill-posedness of the problem. The resulting
                 guidelines necessitate the use of hybrid finite
                 elements composed of tetrahedra and prism elements.
                 Also, in order to maintain consistent numerical quality
                 when the inverse problem is discretized into different
                 scales, we propose a new family of regularizers using
                 the variational principle underlying finite-element
                 methods. These variational-formed regularizers serve as
                 an alternative to the traditional Tikhonov

                 achieves consistent regularization in multiscale

                 simple construction of the discrete gradient operator
                 over irregular meshes, which is difficult to define in
                 traditional discretization schemes. We validated our

                 regularizers by simulations on a realistic 3-D
                 torso/heart model with empirical heart data. Results
                 show that discretization based on our proposed
                 strategies mitigates the ill-conditioning and improves
                 the inverse solution, and that the variational
                 formulation may benefit a broader range of

                 ischemic disease using body-surface potential
                 recordings, we attempted to reconstruct the
                 transmembrane potential (TMP) throughout the myocardium
                 with the bidomain heart model. The task is an inverse
                 source problem governed by partial differential
                 equations (PDE). Our main contribution is solving the
                 inverse problem within a PDE-constrained optimization
                 framework that enables various physically-based
                 constraints in both equality and inequality forms. We
                 formulated the optimality conditions rigorously in the
                 continuum before deriving finite element
                 discretization, thereby making the optimization
                 independent of discretization choice. Such a
                 formulation was derived for the L2-norm Tikhonov
                 regularization and the total variation minimization.
                 The subsequent numerical optimization was fulfilled by
                 a primalâ€“dual interior-point method tailored to our
                 problemâ€™s specific structure. Our simulations used
                 realistic, fiber-included heart models consisting of up
                 to 18,000 nodes, much finer than any inverse models
                 previously reported. With synthetic ischemia data we
                 localized ischemic regions with roughly a 10\%
                 false-negative rate or a 20\% false-positive rate under
                 conditions up to 5\% input noise. With ischemia data
                 measured from animal experiments, we reconstructed TMPs
                 with roughly 0.9 correlation with the ground truth.
                 While precisely estimating the TMP in general cases
                 remains an open problem, our study shows the
                 feasibility of reconstructing TMP during the ST

                 potential distributions was studied in 13 dogs. In
                 previous studies, left ventricular epicardial pacing
                 generated epicardial potential maps at QRS onset with a
                 negative central area and two positive areas that faced
                 the portions of the wavefront propagating along fibers.
                 Subsequently, the positive areas expanded in a
                 counterclockwise direction by 90 degrees to 120
                 degrees. In those studies, the rotatory expansion of
                 the positive areas was tentatively attributed to the
                 spread of excitation through deep myocardial layers,
                 where fiber direction rotated counterclockwise from
                 epicardium to endocardium. To test this hypothesis, we
                 tried to interrupt the counterclockwise expansion of
                 the positive area by creating localized, nontransmural
                 necrosis at various depths in the left ventricular wall
                 by injection of formalin or application of laser

                 Epicardial pacing from selected sites generated
                 epicardial maps in which some positive areas were
                 missing compared with controls. The direction of the
                 straight line joining the pacing site to the site of
                 missing positivity correlated well with the average
                 fiber direction in the necrotic mass (r = 0.82, p less
                 than 0.01). Angle between epicardial fiber direction
                 and the straight line described above correlated well
                 with the average depth of the necrosis, expressed as
                 percent of the wall thickness (r = 0.95, p less than
                 0.01). These data support the hypothesis that the
                 counterclockwise expansion of the epicardial positivity
                 occurring after epicardial pacing results from
                 excitation spreading along deep fibers.(ABSTRACT

                 Simulations also indicate that the predominant

                 programming with orthogonal least squares (GP/OLS) and
                 simulated annealing (GP/SA) were applied to the
                 detection of atrial fibrillation (AF) episodes.
                 Empirical equations were obtained to classify the
                 samples of AF and Normal episodes based on the analysis
                 of RR interval signals. Another important contribution
                 of this paper was to identify the effective time domain
                 features of heart rate variability (HRV) signals via an
                 improved forward floating selection analysis. The
                 models were developed using the MITâ€“BIH arrhythmia
                 database. A radial basis function (RBF) neural
                 networks-based model was further developed using the
                 same features and data sets to benchmark the GP/OLS and
                 GP/SA models. The diagnostic performance of the GP/OLS
                 and GP/SA classifiers was evaluated using receiver
                 operating characteristics analysis. The results
                 indicate a high level of efficacy of the GP/OLS model
                 with sensitivity, specificity, positive predictivity,
                 and accuracy rates of 99.11\%, 98.91\%, 98.23\%, and
                 99.02\%, respectively. These rates are equal to
                 99.11\%, 97.83\%, 98.23\%, and 98.534\% for the GP/SA
                 model. The proposed GP/OLS and GP/SA models have a

                 electrocardiogram (ECG) include J (Osborn) waves,
                 ST-segments, and T- and U-waves, which dynamically
                 change in morphology under various pathophysiologic
                 conditions and play an important role in the
                 development of ventricular arrhythmias. Our primary
                 objective in this review is to identify the ionic and
                 cellular basis for ventricular repolarization
                 components on the body surface ECG under normal and
                 pathologic conditions, including a discussion of their
                 clinical significance. A specific attempt to combine
                 typical clinical ECG tracings with transmembrane
                 electrical recordings is made to illustrate their
                 logical linkage. A transmural voltage gradient during
                 initial ventricular repolarization, which results from
                 the presence of a prominent transient outward K+
                 current (Ito)-mediated action potential (AP) notch in
                 the epicardium, but not endocardium, manifests as a
                 J-wave on the ECG. The J-wave is associated with the
                 early repolarization syndrome and Brugada syndrome.
                 ST-segment elevation, as seen in Brugada syndrome and
                 acute myocardial ischemia, cannot be fully explained by
                 using the classic concept of an â€œinjury currentâ€
                 that flows from injured to uninjured myocardium.
                 Rather, ST-segment elevation may be largely secondary
                 to a loss of the AP dome in the epicardium, but not
                 endocardium. The T-wave is a symbol of transmural
                 dispersion of repolarization. The R-on-T phenomenon (an
                 extrasystole originating on the T-wave of a preceding
                 ventricular beat) is probably due to transmural
                 propagation of phase 2 re-entry or phase 2 early
                 afterdepolarization that could potentially initiate

                 closely coupled R-on-T extrasystole leading to
                 ventricular fibrillation (VF) under conditions of
                 ST-segment elevation unrelated to ischemia. The present

                 initiation of VF during early myocardial
                 ischemia.Regional myocardial ischemia was produced in
                 an isolated, arterially perfused canine right
                 ventricular wedge preparation. Transmembrane APs from 2
                 epicardial sites at each side of the ischemic border
                 were simultaneously recorded together with measurements
                 of extracellular potassium concentration ([K+]o) and a
                 transmural ECG. Loss of the I(to)-mediated epicardial
                 AP dome in the ischemic zone but not in the perfused
                 tissue resulted in phase 2 reentry and associated
                 R-on-T extrasystoles capable of initiating VF in 7 of
                 15 preparations during the first 3 to 9 minutes of
                 myocardial ischemia, with marked ST-segment elevation
                 and [K+]o accumulation. The I(to) and phase 1 magnitude
                 of epicardium contributed importantly to the onset of
                 VF. Phase 1 magnitude and I(to) density at +30 mV in
                 the group with phase 2 reentry-related R-on-T
                 extrasystoles were 32.2+/-1.3 mV and 30.3+/-0.5 pA/pF
                 (n=7), respectively, significantly greater than those
                 (24.0+/-1.8 mV and 23.2+/-1.0 pA/pF) in the group
                 without the extrasystoles (n=8, P&lt;0.01).Acute
                 regional myocardial ischemia results in markedly
                 heterogeneous loss of I(to)-mediated epicardial AP
                 domes across the ischemic border, leading to phase 2
                 reentry. Phase 2 reentry can in turn produce an R-on-T

                 approaches, including the array of pharmacological
                 methods that have been tried to date, the restoration

                 reperfusion appears to be the prerequisite for tissue
                 salvage, as in many positive arenas, there tends to be
                 a negative aspect. Not only does reperfusion salvage
                 tissue but there appears to be evidence that the
                 process of reperfusion itself also carries with it a
                 component of injury which can prove deleterious to the
                 ischemic myocardium. This article therefore addresses

                 undergoing reperfusion therapy in acute myocardial
                 infarction. The most practical approach in treatment of
                 patients with acute myocardial infarction involves
                 intravenous administration of effective thrombolytic
                 agents as soon as possible in the course of myocardial
                 infarction. This approach using r-tPA results in
                 reperfusion in approximately two-thirds of patients. In
                 patients with contraindications to thrombolytic therapy
                 and extensive injury current or hemodynamic compromise,
                 emergent cardiac catheterization should be performed
                 followed by immediate PTCA or bypass surgery. In
                 patients who have already been treated with
                 thrombolytic agents, controversy exists as to the
                 optimal timing of cardiac catheterization to define
                 coronary anatomy and the need for additional
                 revascularization. We suggest that the most beneficial
                 therapeutic strategy for the majority of patients is
                 rapid administration of an effective intravenous
                 thrombolytic agent combined with aspirin and heparin.
                 Cardiac catheterization and PTCA or coronary artery
                 bypass graft surgery may be deferred in stable
                 patients. This approach is supported by evidence
                 showing a lack of additional improvement in mortality
                 and left ventricular function in patients treated with
                 urgent PTCA. The advent of new therapeutic modalities
                 in acute myocardial infarction, such as thrombolysis,
                 has created a new subset of patients who either will
                 have an improved prognosis if coronary artery
                 reperfusion is completed or will have an increased risk
                 for recurrent myocardial ischemia if definite

                 with acute coronary syndromes. Most authors have
                 attributed it to transient reductions in coronary blood
                 flow due to nonocclusive thrombus formation on a
                 disrupted atherosclerotic plaque and dynamic focal
                 vasospasm at the site of coronary artery stenosis.
                 However, ST-segment depression was never reproduced in
                 classic animal models of coronary stenosis without the
                 presence of tachycardia. We hypothesized that
                 ST-segment depression occurring during acute coronary
                 syndromes is not entirely explained by changes in
                 epicardial coronary artery resistance and thus
                 evaluated the effect of a slow, progressive epicardial
                 coronary artery occlusion on the ECG and regional
                 myocardial blood flow in anesthetized pigs. Slow,
                 progressive occlusion over 72 min (SD 27) of the left
                 anterior descending coronary artery in 20 anesthetized
                 pigs led to a 90\% decrease in coronary blood flow and
                 the development of ST-segment elevation associated with
                 homogeneous and transmural myocardial blood flow
                 reductions, confirmed by microspheres and myocardial
                 contrast echocardiography. ST-segment depression was
                 not observed in any ECG lead before the development of
                 ST-segment elevation. At normal heart rates,
                 progressive epicardial stenosis of a coronary artery
                 results in myocardial ischemia associated with
                 homogeneous, transmural reduction in regional
                 myocardial blood flow and ST-segment elevation, without
                 preceding ST-segment depression. Thus, in coronary
                 syndromes with ST-segment depression and predominant
                 subendocardial ischemia, factors other than mere
                 increases in epicardial coronary resistance must be
                 invoked to explain the heterogeneous parietal
                 distribution of flow and associated ECG changes.",

                 generator and of the properties of the body as a volume
                 conductor, both playing a major role in the shaping of
                 the electrocardiographic waveforms recorded at the body
                 surface. It is claimed that the Forward-Problem of
                 electrocardiography is no longer a problem. Several
                 source models of cardiac electrical activity are
