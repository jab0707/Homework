abstract = {The devastating sequelae of diabetes mellitus include microvascular permeability, which results in retinopathy. Despite clinical and scientific advances, there remains a need for new approaches to treat retinopathy. Here, we have presented a possible treatment strategy, whereby targeting the small GTPase ARF6 alters VEGFR2 trafficking and reverses signs of pathology in 4 animal models that represent features of diabetic retinopathy and in a fifth model of ocular pathological angiogenesis. Specifically, we determined that the same signaling pathway utilizes distinct GEFs to sequentially activate ARF6, and these GEFs exert distinct but complementary effects on VEGFR2 trafficking and signal transduction. ARF6 activation was independently regulated by 2 different ARF GEFs - ARNO and GEP100. Interaction between VEGFR2 and ARNO activated ARF6 and stimulated VEGFR2 internalization, whereas a VEGFR2 interaction with GEP100 activated ARF6 to promote VEGFR2 recycling via coreceptor binding. Intervening in either pathway inhibited VEGFR2 signal output. Finally, using a combination of in vitro, cellular, genetic, and pharmacologic techniques, we demonstrated that ARF6 is pivotal in VEGFR2 trafficking and that targeting ARF6-mediated VEGFR2 trafficking has potential as a therapeutic approach for retinal vascular diseases such as diabetic retinopathy.},

	abstract = {Sudden death accounts for 300,000-400,000 deaths annually in the United States. Most sudden deaths are cardiac, and most sudden cardiac deaths are related to arrhythmias secondary to structural heart disease or primary electrical abnormalities of the heart. The most common structural disease leading to sudden death is ischemic heart disease. Nonischemic cardiomyopathy and other structural abnormalities such as arrhythmogenic ventricular dysplasia and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy may also be causative. Patients without structural disease have a primary electrical abnormality, such as long-QT syndrome or Brugada syndrome. Severe left ventricular systolic dysfunction is the main marker for sudden death in patients with ischemic or nonischemic cardiomyopathy. In other conditions, other markers for structural heart disease and electrical abnormalities need to be considered. It is seen that $\beta$-blocker therapy is associated with a reduction in sudden cardiac death across a broad range of disorders. Nevertheless, the implantable cardioverter defibrillator remains the most effective treatment strategy in selected patients.},

They are evaluated on a triangulated spherical surface for which the analytical expression of the surface Laplacian is known. It is shown that in order to obtain accurate results, due care has to be taken of irregularities present in the triangulation grid. If this is done, the approximation will equal the performance of an expression based on least squares which can be derived. Next the different approximations obtained are used as a regularization operator in the solution of an ill-posed inverse problem in electrical volume conduction.

abstract = {Background: Computational models of myocardial ischemia often use oversimplified ischemic source representations to simulate epicardial potentials. The purpose of this study was to explore the influence of biophysically justified, subject-specific ischemic zone representations on epicardial potentials. Methods: We developed and implemented an image-based simulation pipeline, using intramural recordings from a canine experimental model to define subject-specific ischemic regions within the heart. Static epicardial potential distributions, reflective of ST segment deviations, were simulated and validated against measured epicardial recordings. Results: Simulated epicardial potential distributions showed strong statistical correlation and visual agreement with measured epicardial potentials. Additionally, we identified and described in what way border zone parameters influence epicardial potential distributions during the ST segment. Conclusion: From image-based simulations of myocardial ischemia, we generated subject-specific ischemic sources that accurately replicated epicardial potential distributions. Such models are essential in understanding the underlying mechanisms of the bioelectric fields that arise during ischemia and are the basis for more sophisticated simulations of body surface ECGs.},

@article{DaFaria2008,
abstract = {Cardiac electrical activity depends on the coordinated propagation of excitatory stimuli through the heart and, as a consequence, the generation of action potentials in individual cardiomyocytes. Action potential formation results from the opening and closing (gating) of ion channels that are expressed within the sarcolemma of cardiomyocytes. Ion channels possess distinct genetic, molecular, pharmacologic, and gating properties and exhibit dissimilar expression levels within different cardiac regions. By gating, ion channels permit ion currents across the sarcolemma, thereby creating the different phases of the action potential (e.g., resting phase, depolarization, repolarization). The importance of ion channels in maintaining normal heart rhythm is reflected by the increased incidence of arrhythmias in inherited diseases that are linked to mutations in genes encoding ion channels or their accessory proteins and in acquired diseases that are associated with changes in ion channel expression levels or gating properties. This review discusses ion channels that contribute to action potential formation in healthy hearts and their role in inherited and acquired diseases.},

abstract = {The experimental and clinical possibilities for studying cardiac arrhythmias in human ventricular myocardium are very limited. Therefore, the use of alternative methods such as computer simulations is of great importance. In this article we introduce a mathematical model of the action potential of human ventricular cells that, while including a high level of electrophysiological detail, is computationally cost-effective enough to be applied in large-scale spatial simulations for the study of reentrant arrhythmias. The model is based on recent experimental data on most of the major ionic currents: the fast sodium, L-type calcium, transient outward, rapid and slow delayed rectifier, and inward rectifier currents. The model includes a basic calcium dynamics, allowing for the realistic modeling of calcium transients, calcium current inactivation, and the contraction staircase. We are able to reproduce human epicardial, endocardial, and M cell action potentials and show that differences can be explained by differences in the transient outward and slow delayed rectifier currents. Our model reproduces the experimentally observed data on action potential duration restitution, which is an important characteristic for reentrant arrhythmias. The conduction velocity restitution of our model is broader than in other models and agrees better with available data. Finally, we model the dynamics of spiral wave rotation in a two-dimensional sheet of human ventricular tissue and show that the spiral wave follows a complex meandering pattern and has a period of 265 ms. We conclude that the proposed model reproduces a variety of electrophysiological behaviors and provides a basis for studies of reentrant arrhythmias in human ventricular tissue.},

abstract = {A heuristic method has been developed for registering two sets of 3-D curves obtained by using an edge-based stereo system, or two dense 3-D maps obtained by using a correlation-based stereo system. Geometric matching in general is a difficult unsolved problem in computer vision. Fortunately, in many practical applications, some a priori knowledge exists which considerably simplifies the problem. In visual navigation, for example, the motion between successive positions is usually approximately known. From this initial estimate, our algorithm computes observer motion with very good precision, which is required for environment modeling (e.g., building a Digital Elevation Map). Objects are represented by a set of 3-D points, which are considered as the samples of a surface. No constraint is imposed on the form of the objects. The proposed algorithm is based on iteratively matching points in one set to the closest points in the other. A statistical method based on the distance distribution is used to deal with outliers, occlusion, appearance and disappearance, which allows us to do subset-subset matching. A least-squares technique is used to estimate 3-D motion from the point correspondences, which reduces the average distance between points in the two sets. Both synthetic and real data have been used to test the algorithm, and the results show that it is efficient and robust, and yields an accurate motion estimate.},

abstract = {The mechanisms underlying many important properties of the human atrial action potential (AP) are poorly understood. Using specific formulations of the K+, Na+, and Ca2+ currents based on data recorded from human atrial myocytes, along with representations of pump, exchange, and background currents, we developed a mathematical model of the AP. The model AP resembles APs recorded from human atrial samples and responds to rate changes, L-type Ca2+ current blockade, Na+/Ca2+ exchanger inhibition, and variations in transient outward current amplitude in a fashion similar to experimental recordings. Rate-dependent adaptation of AP duration, an important determinant of susceptibility to atrial fibrillation, was attributable to incomplete L-type Ca2+ current recovery from inactivation and incomplete delayed rectifier current deactivation at rapid rates. Experimental observations of variable AP morphology could be accounted for by changes in transient outward current density, as suggested experimentally. We conclude that this mathematical model of the human atrial AP reproduces a variety of observed AP behaviors and provides insights into the mechanisms of clinically important AP properties.},

abstract = {Anion channelrhodopsin-2 (ACR2), a light-gated channel recently identified from the cryptophyte alga Guillardia theta, exhibits anion channel activity with exclusive selectivity. In addition to its novel function, ACR2 has become a focus of interest as a powerful tool for optogenetics. Here we combined experimental and computational approaches to investigate the roles of conserved carboxylates on the anion transport activity of ACR2 in Escherichia coli membrane. First, we replaced six conserved carboxylates with a neutral residue (i.e. E9Q, E56Q, E64Q, E159Q, E219Q and D230N), and measured anion transport activity using E. coli expression system. E159Q and D230N exhibited significantly lower anion transport activity compared with wild-type ACR2 (1/12{\~{}}1/3.4), which suggests that E159 and D230 play important roles in the anion transport. Second, to explain its molecular aspects, we constructed a homology model of ACR2 based on the crystal structure of a cation channelrhodopsin (ChR). The model structure showed a cavity formed by four transmembrane helices (TM1, TM2, TM3 and TM7) similar to ChRs, as a putative anion conducting pathway. Although E159 is not located in the putative pathway, the model structure showed hydrogen bonds between E159 and R129 with a water molecule. D230 is located in the pathway near the protonated Schiff base (PSB) of the chromophore retinal, which suggests that there is an interaction between D230 and the PSB. Thus, we demonstrated the functional importance and the hypothetical roles of two conserved carboxylates, E159 and D230, in the anion transport activity of ACR2 in E. coli membrane.},

abstract = {Background. Left ventricular disease occurs frequently in dialysis patients. It may be manifest as concentric LV hypertrophy, LV dilatation with or without LV hypertrophy, or systolic dysfunction. Little is known concerning the clinical outcome and risk factors for these disorders. Methods. A cohort of 432 end-stage renal disease patients who survived at least 6 months had an echo-cardiogram on initiation of dialysis therapy. Clinical, laboratory and echocardiographic data was obtained annually during follow-up. Results. On initiation of ESRD therapy 16{\%} of patients had systolic dysfunction, 41{\%} concentric LV hypertrophy, 28{\%} LV dilatation, and only 16{\%} had normal echocardiograms. Median time to development of heart failure was 19 months in patients with systolic dysfunction, 38 months in concentric LV hypertrophy and 38 months in LV dilatation. The relative risks of heart failure in the three groups were significantly worse than in the normal group, after adjusting for age, diabetes and ischaemic heart disease. Median survival was 38 months in systolic dysfunction, 48 months in concentric hypertrophy, 56 months in LV dilatation, and {\textgreater}66 months in the normal group. Two hundred and seventy-five patients had a follow-up echocardiogram 17 months after starting dialysis therapy together with serial measurement of potential risk factors prior to the echocardiogram. On follow-up echocardiogram the degree of concentric LV hyper-trophy was independently related to hypertension while on dialysis, older age, and anaemia while on dialysis; the degree of LV dilatation was related to ischaemic heart disease, anaemia, hypertension and hypoalbumi-nemia while on dialysis; the degree of systolic dysfunc-tion was associated with ischaemic heart disease and anaemia during follow-up. Conclusions. Manifestations of left ventricular disease are frequent and persistent in chronic uraemia, and Correspondence and offprint requests to: are associated with high risks of heart failure and death. Potentially reversible risk factors include anae-mia, hypertension, hypoalbuminaemia and ischaemic heart disease.},

abstract = {Concerns have been raised frequently about caffeine's potential for increasing blood pressure (BP) and posing a risk for cardiovascular disease. This review surveys research concerning the effects of caffeine on BP and heart rate (HR). Tolerance to caffeine, family history of hypertension, borderline hypertension, and hypertension are also examined as potential moderators. Results from epidemiological studies are inconsistent. Experimental laboratory studies have generally found that caffeine produces acute rises in systolic and diastolic BP that are additive to any stress-induced increases. Synergistic effects which might pose a more serious risk are rarely found. Heart rate data are less consistent, possibly due to the different ways HR is measured. Tolerance to the cardiovascular effects of caffeine has reliably been reported; however, overnight abstinence may be sufficient to negate tolerance effects to most levels of caffeine ingestion in typical caffeine users. Though caffeine drinkers may exhibit acute increases in BP, the long-term effects appear to be minimal. However, persons at risk for hypertension may be more vulnerable to the BP effects of caffeine.},

abstract = {Background— The mode of death has been well characterized in patients with heart failure and a reduced ejection fraction; however, less is known about the mode of death in patients with heart failure and a preserved ejection fraction (HFPEF). The purpose of this study was to examine the mode of death in patients with HFPEF enrolled in the Irbesartan in Heart Failure With Preserved Ejection Fraction Study (I-Preserve) trial and to determine whether irbesartan altered the distribution of mode of death in HFPEF. Methods and Results— All deaths were reviewed by a clinical end-point committee, and the mode of death was assigned by consensus of the members. The annual mortality rate was 5.2{\%} in the I-Preserve trial. There were no significant differences in mortality rate between the placebo and irbesartan groups. The mode of death was cardiovascular in 60{\%} (including 26{\%} sudden, 14{\%} heart failure, 5{\%} myocardial infarction, and 9{\%} stroke), noncardiovascular in 30{\%}, and unknown in 10{\%}. There were no differences in the distribution of mode-specific mortality rates between placebo and irbesartan. Conclusions— Sixty percent of the deaths in patients with HFPEF were cardiovascular, with sudden death and heart failure death being the most common. Treatment with irbesartan did not affect overall mortality or the distribution of mode-specific mortality rates. Clinical Trial Registration— URL: http://www.clinicaltrials.gov.

abstract = {Experimental studies have shown that cardiac fibroblasts are electrically inexcitable, but can contribute to electrophysiology of myocardium in various manners. The aim of this computational study was to give insights in the electrophysiological role of fibroblasts and their interaction with myocytes. We developed a mathematical model of fibroblasts based on data from whole-cell patch clamp and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) studies. The fibroblast model was applied together with models of ventricular myocytes to assess effects of heterogeneous intercellular electrical coupling. We investigated the modulation of action potentials of a single myocyte varying the number of coupled fibroblasts and intercellular resistance. Coupling to fibroblasts had only a minor impact on the myocyte's resting and peak transmembrane voltage, but led to significant changes of action potential duration and upstroke velocity. We examined the impact of fibroblasts on conduction in one-dimensional strands of myocytes. Coupled fibroblasts reduced conduction and upstroke velocity. We studied electrical bridging between ventricular myocytes via fibroblast insets for various coupling resistors. The simulations showed significant conduction delays up to 20.3 ms. In summary, the simulations support strongly the hypothesis that coupling of fibroblasts to myocytes modulates electrophysiology of cardiac cells and tissues.},

abstract = {Previous studies have examined the influence of body position, respiration, and habitus on body surface potentials. However, the authors could only estimate the sources of the effects they documented. Among the proposed origin of changes in body surface potentials from those studies were the position of the heart, alterations in autonomic tone, differences in ventricular blood volume, and variations in torso resistivity. The goal of this study was to investigate specifically the role of geometric factors in altering body surface potentials and the electrocardiogram. For this, we used experiments with an isolated, perfused dog heart suspended in a realistically shaped electrolytic torso tank. The experimental preparation allowed us to measure epicardial and tank surface potentials simultaneously, and then reconstruct the geometry of both surfaces. Our results mimicked some of the features described by previous investigators. However, our results also showed differences that included considerably larger changes in the peak QRS and T-wave amplitudes with heart movement than those reported in human studies. We detected smaller values of root-mean-squared variability from heart movements than those reported in a human study comparing body surface potentials during change in inspiration and body position. There was better agreement with relative variability, which in these studies ranged from 0.11 to 0.42, agreeing well with an estimate from human studies of 0.40. Our results suggest that the isolated heart/torso tank preparation is a valuable tool for investigating the effects of geometric variation. Furthermore, the geometric position of the heart appears to be a large source of variation in body surface potentials. The size of these variations easily exceeded thresholds used to distinguish pathologic conditions and thus such variations could have important implications on the interpretation of the standard electrocardiogram.},

abstract = {Sudden death accounts for 300,000-400,000 deaths annually in the United States. Most sudden deaths are cardiac, and most sudden cardiac deaths are related to arrhythmias secondary to structural heart disease or primary electrical abnormalities of the heart. The most common structural disease leading to sudden death is ischemic heart disease. Nonischemic cardiomyopathy and other structural abnormalities such as arrhythmogenic ventricular dysplasia and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy may also be causative. Patients without structural disease have a primary electrical abnormality, such as long-QT syndrome or Brugada syndrome. Severe left ventricular systolic dysfunction is the main marker for sudden death in patients with ischemic or nonischemic cardiomyopathy. In other conditions, other markers for structural heart disease and electrical abnormalities need to be considered. It is seen that $\beta$-blocker therapy is associated with a reduction in sudden cardiac death across a broad range of disorders. Nevertheless, the implantable cardioverter defibrillator remains the most effective treatment strategy in selected patients.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: The relationship between epicardial and body surface potentials defines the forward problem of electrocardiography. A robust formulation of the forward problem is instrumental to solving the inverse problem, in which epicardial potentials are computed from known body surface potentials. Here, the accuracy of different forward models has been evaluated experimentally.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS AND RESULTS: Body surface and epicardial potentials were recorded simultaneously in anesthetized closed-chest pigs (n=5) during sinus rhythm, and epicardial and endocardial ventricular pacing (65 records in total). Body surface potentials were simulated from epicardial recordings using experiment-specific volume conductor models constructed from magnetic resonance imaging. Results for homogeneous (isotropic electric properties) and inhomogeneous (incorporating lungs, anisotropic skeletal muscle, and subcutaneous fat) forward models were compared with measured body surface potentials. Correlation coefficients were 0.85±0.08 across all animals and activation sequences with no significant difference between homogeneous and inhomogeneous solutions (P=0.85). Despite this, there was considerable variance between simulated and measured body surface potential distributions. Differences between the body surface potential extrema predicted with homogeneous forward models were 55{\%} to 78{\%} greater than observed (P{\textless}0.05) and attenuation of potentials adjacent to extrema were 10{\%} to 171{\%} greater (P{\textless}0.03). The length and orientation of the vector between potential extrema were also significantly different. Inclusion of inhomogeneous electric properties in the forward model reduced, but did not eliminate these differences.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: These results demonstrate that homogeneous volume conductor models introduce substantial spatial inaccuracies in forward problem solutions. This probably affects the precision of inverse reconstructions of cardiac potentials, in which this assumption is made.},

abstract = {Background: Rapid accurate localization of the site of ventricular activation origin during catheter ablation for ventricular arrhythmias could facilitate the procedure. Electrocardiographic imaging (ECGI) using large lead sets can localize the origin of ventricular activation. We have developed an automated method to identify sites of early ventricular activation in real time using the 12-lead ECG. We aim to compare the localization accuracy of ECGI and the automated method, identifying pacing sites/VT exit based on a patient-specific model. Methods: A patient undergoing ablation of VT on the left-ventricular endocardium and epicardium had 120-lead body-surface potential mapping (BSPM) recorded during the procedure. (1) ECGI methodology: The L1-norm regularization was employed to reconstruct epicardial potentials based on patient-specific geometry for localizing endocardial ventricular activation origin. We used the BSPM data corresponding to known endocardial pacing sites and a VT exit site identified by 3D contact mapping to analyze them offline. (2) The automated method: location coordinates of pacing sites together with the time integral of the first 120 ms of the QRS complex of 3 ECG predictors (leads III, V2 and V6) were used to calculate patient-specific regression coefficients to predict the location of unknown sites of ventricular activation origin (“target” sites). Localization error was quantified over all pacing sites in millimeters by comparing the calculated location and the known reference location. Results: Localization was tested for 14 endocardial pacing sites and 1 epicardial VT exit site. For 14 endocardial pacing sites the mean localization error of the automated method was significantly lower than that of the ECGI (8.9 vs. 24.9 mm, p {\textless} 0.01), when 10 training pacing sites are used. Emulation of a clinical procedure demonstrated that the automated method achieved localization error of {\textless}5 mm for the VT-exit site; while the ECGI approach approximately correlates with the site of VT exit from the scar within a distance of 18.4 mm. Conclusions: The automated method using only 3 ECGs shows promise to localize the origin of ventricular activation as tested by pacing, and the VT-exit site and compares favourably to inverse solution calculation, avoiding cumbersome lead sets. As 12-lead ECG data is acquired by current 3D mapping systems, it is conceivable that the algorithm could be directly incorporated into a mapping system. Further validation in a prospective cohort study is needed to confirm and extend observations reported in this study.},

abstract = {The small airways constitute one of the least understood areas of the lungs. They play a role in many lung diseases, and small airway pathology results in significant morbidity. New approaches to their evaluation may provide insights into this major area of lung disease. Asthma is well recognized as a disease of both large and small airways. Physiological and pathological evidence, from techniques such as post-mortem tissue histological analysis, induced sputum and transbronchial biopsies, has reinforced the concept of the involvement of the entire bronchial tree in the inflammatory process in asthma. In addition to describing the airway pathology in asthma, this review focuses on the pathogenesis and role of small airway obstruction in other diseases, including chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), sarcoidosis and obliterative bronchiolitis (OB). COPD is characterized by the presence of airflow obstruction resulting from lesions in the small airways. In addition, features compatible with small airways disease are common in IPF, sarcoidosis and OB. Recent advances in pulmonary imaging, such as high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with hyperpolarized3He, have allowed non-invasive reproducible measurements of structure-function relationships to be made for the small airways. These techniques have great potential for diagnosing changes in small airway function and for assessing responses to treatment. New insights into the contribution of small airways to a range of lung diseases may lead to the development of therapies targeted at this part of the bronchial anatomy. {\textcopyright} 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.},

abstract = {With the goal of non-invasively localizing cardiac ischemic disease using body-surface potential recordings, we attempted to reconstruct the transmembrane potential (TMP) throughout the myocardium with the bidomain heart model. The task is an inverse source problem governed by partial differential equations (PDE). Our main contribution is solving the inverse problem within a PDE-constrained optimization framework that enables various physically-based constraints in both equality and inequality forms. We formulated the optimality conditions rigorously in the continuum before deriving finite element discretization, thereby making the optimization independent of discretization choice. Such a formulation was derived for the L2-norm Tikhonov regularization and the total variation minimization. The subsequent numerical optimization was fulfilled by a primal-dual interior-point method tailored to our problem's specific structure. Our simulations used realistic, fiber-included heart models consisting of up to 18,000 nodes, much finer than any inverse models previously reported. With synthetic ischemia data we localized ischemic regions with roughly a 10{\%} false-negative rate or a 20{\%} false-positive rate under conditions up to 5{\%} input noise. With ischemia data measured from animal experiments, we reconstructed TMPs with roughly 0.9 correlation with the ground truth. While precisely estimating the TMP in general cases remains an open problem, our study shows the feasibility of reconstructing TMP during the ST interval as a means of ischemia localization. {\textcopyright} 2013.},

abstract = {The main aim of this paper was to computationally simulate the cardiac ischemia employing Finite Element Method (FEM) and detect its presence and localization using data mining approach. A simplified heart-torso model was created based on computed tomography (CT) images, with performed segmentation of the heart (17 zones). Ischemic and non-ischemic cardiac beats were simulated in different zones with aim to create a virtual database which was used for data mining. Using the virtual database, we trained several classifiers and tested them for the purpose of ischemic beat detection based on the body surface potentials map (BSPM). If the ECG is classified as ischemic by the first stage classifier, potentials were processed by the second stage data mining model, which predicted the location of the ischemic area. The use of the second stage classifier, which located the ischemia in one of the heart's segments created in the FEM model, goes beyond the current state of the art. Thus, the proposed approach is improved solution which can instantly allow clinicians to implement an adequate treatment strategy in future.},

abstract = {The eukaryotic RNA exosome is an essential, multi-subunit complex that catalyzes RNA turnover, maturation, and quality control processes. Its non-catalytic donut-shaped core includes 9 subunits that associate with the 3' to 5' exoribonucleases Rrp6, and Rrp44/Dis3, a subunit that also catalyzes endoribonuclease activity. Although recent structures and biochemical studies of RNA bound exosomes from S. cerevisiae revealed that the Exo9 central channel guides RNA to either Rrp6 or Rrp44 using partially overlapping and mutually exclusive paths, several issues related to RNA recruitment remain. Here, we identify activities for the highly basic Rrp6 C-terminal tail that we term the 'lasso' because it binds RNA and stimulates ribonuclease activities associated with Rrp44 and Rrp6 within the 11-subunit nuclear exosome. Stimulation is dependent on the Exo9 central channel, and the lasso contributes to degradation and processing activities of exosome substrates in vitro and in vivo. Finally, we present evidence that the Rrp6 lasso may be a conserved feature of the eukaryotic RNA exosome.},

abstract = {Background: Rapid accurate localization of the site of ventricular activation origin during catheter ablation for ventricular arrhythmias could facilitate the procedure. Electrocardiographic imaging (ECGI) using large lead sets can localize the origin of ventricular activation. We have developed an automated method to identify sites of early ventricular activation in real time using the 12-lead ECG. We aim to compare the localization accuracy of ECGI and the automated method, identifying pacing sites/VT exit based on a patient-specific model. Methods: A patient undergoing ablation of VT on the left-ventricular endocardium and epicardium had 120-lead body-surface potential mapping (BSPM) recorded during the procedure. (1) ECGI methodology: The L1-norm regularization was employed to reconstruct epicardial potentials based on patient-specific geometry for localizing endocardial ventricular activation origin. We used the BSPM data corresponding to known endocardial pacing sites and a VT exit site identified by 3D contact mapping to analyze them offline. (2) The automated method: location coordinates of pacing sites together with the time integral of the first 120 ms of the QRS complex of 3 ECG predictors (leads III, V2 and V6) were used to calculate patient-specific regression coefficients to predict the location of unknown sites of ventricular activation origin (“target” sites). Localization error was quantified over all pacing sites in millimeters by comparing the calculated location and the known reference location. Results: Localization was tested for 14 endocardial pacing sites and 1 epicardial VT exit site. For 14 endocardial pacing sites the mean localization error of the automated method was significantly lower than that of the ECGI (8.9 vs. 24.9 mm, p {\textless} 0.01), when 10 training pacing sites are used. Emulation of a clinical procedure demonstrated that the automated method achieved localization error of {\textless}5 mm for the VT-exit site; while the ECGI approach approximately correlates with the site of VT exit from the scar within a distance of 18.4 mm. Conclusions: The automated method using only 3 ECGs shows promise to localize the origin of ventricular activation as tested by pacing, and the VT-exit site and compares favourably to inverse solution calculation, avoiding cumbersome lead sets. As 12-lead ECG data is acquired by current 3D mapping systems, it is conceivable that the algorithm could be directly incorporated into a mapping system. Further validation in a prospective cohort study is needed to confirm and extend observations reported in this study.},

Methods and results: A broad search in electronic databases until August 2017 was performed. Studies on the aforementioned techniques in {\textgreater}100 patients with stable CAD that utilized either ICA or ICA with FFR measurement as reference, were included. Study-level data was pooled using a hierarchical bivariate random-effects model and likelihood ratios were obtained for each technique. The PTP ranges for each technique to rule-in or rule-out significant CAD were defined. A total of 28 664 patients from 132 studies that used ICA as reference and 4131 from 23 studies using FFR, were analysed. Stress ECG can rule-in and rule-out anatomically significant CAD only when PTP is {\textgreater}/=80{\%} (76-83) and {\textless}/=19{\%} (15-25), respectively. Coronary computed tomography angiography is able to rule-in anatomic CAD at a PTP {\textgreater}/=58{\%} (45-70) and rule-out at a PTP {\textless}/=80{\%} (65-94). The corresponding PTP values for functionally significant CAD were {\textgreater}/=75{\%} (67-83) and {\textless}/=57{\%} (40-72) for CCTA, and {\textgreater}/=71{\%} (59-81) and {\textless}/=27 (24-31) for ICA, demonstrating poorer performance of anatomic imaging against FFR. In contrast, functional imaging techniques (PET, stress CMR, and SPECT) are able to rule-in functionally significant CAD when PTP is {\textgreater}/=46-59{\%} and rule-out when PTP is {\textless}/=34-57{\%}. Conclusion: The various diagnostic modalities have different optimal performance ranges for the detection of anatomically and functionally significant CAD. Stress ECG appears to have very limited diagnostic power. The selection of a diagnostic technique for any given patient to rule-in or rule-out CAD should be based on the optimal PTP range for each test and on the assumed reference standard.},

If this is done, the approximation will equal the performance of an expression based on least squares which can be derived. Next the different approximations obtained are used as a regularization operator in the solution of an ill-posed inverse problem in electrical volume conduction.

abstract = {Myocardial infarction (MI) is among the leading causes of death in the United States. It is imperative to identify and characterize MIs for timely delivery of life-saving medical interventions. Cardiac electrical activity propagates in space and evolves over time. Traditional works focus on the analysis of time-domain ECG (e.g., 12-lead ECG) on the body surface for the detection of MIs, but tend to overlook spatiotemporal dynamics in the heart. Body surface potential mappings (BSPMs) provide high-resolution distribution of electric potentials over the entire torso, and therefore provide richer information than 12-lead ECG. However, BSPM are available on the body surface. Clinicians are in need of a closer look of the electric potentials in the heart to investigate cardiac pathology and optimize treatment strategies. In this paper, we applied the method of spatiotemporal inverse ECG (ST-iECG) modeling to map electrical potentials from the body surface to the heart, and then characterize the location and extent of MIs by investigating the reconstructed heart-surface electrograms. First, we investigate the impact of mesh resolution on the inverse ECG modeling. Second, we solve the inverse ECG problem and reconstruct heart-surface electrograms using the ST-iECG model. Finally, we propose a wavelet-clustering method to investigate the pathological behaviors of heart-surface electrograms, and thereby characterize the extent and location of MIs. The proposed methodology is evaluated and validated with real data of MIs from human subjects. Experimental results show that negative QRS waves in heart-surface electrograms indicate potential regions of MI, and the proposed ST-iECG model yields superior characterization results of MIs on the heart surface over existing methods.},

abstract = {Imaging the myocardial activation sequence is critical for improved diagnosis and treatment of life-threatening cardiac arrhythmias. It is desirable to reveal the underlying cardiac electrical activity throughout the three-dimensional (3-D) myocardium (rather than just the endocardial or epicardial surface) from noninvasive body surface potential measurements. A new 3-D electrocardiographic imaging technique (3-DEIT) based on the boundary element method (BEM) and multiobjective nonlinear optimization has been applied to reconstruct the cardiac activation sequences from body surface potential maps. Ultrafast computerized tomography scanning was performed for subsequent construction of the torso and heart models. Experimental studies were then conducted, during left and right ventricular pacing, in which noninvasive assessment of ventricular activation sequence by means of 3-DEIT was performed simultaneously with 3-D intracardiac mapping (up to 200 intramural sites) using specially designed plunge-needle electrodes in closed-chest rabbits. Estimated activation sequences from 3-DEIT were in good agreement with those constructed from simultaneously recorded intracardiac electrograms in the same animals. Averaged over 100 paced beats (from a total of 10 pacing sites), total activation times were comparable (53.3 +/- 8.1 vs. 49.8 +/- 5.2 ms), the localization error of site of initiation of activation was 5.73 +/- 1.77 mm, and the relative error between the estimated and measured activation sequences was 0.32 +/- 0.06. The present experimental results demonstrate that the 3-D paced ventricular activation sequence can be reconstructed by using noninvasive multisite body surface electrocardiographic measurements and imaging of heart-torso geometry. This new 3-D electrocardiographic imaging modality has the potential to guide catheter-based ablative interventions for the treatment of life-threatening cardiac arrhythmias.},

abstract = {We recorded 60 DC-extracellular electrograms simultaneously from epicardial and intra- mural sites of the left ventricle of isolated perfused porcine and canine hearts during the first 15 minutes after occlusion of the left anterior descending coronary artery. During coronary occlusion, maximal current flow across the ischemic border occurred when normal cells had repolarized and ischemic cells had not. At that moment, maximal current sources at the normal side of the ischemic border were in the order of 2 /iA/mm3 and maximal current sinks were — 5 /tiA/mm3. During propagation of a broad wavefront in nonischemic myocardium, current sources in the wake of the wavefront were about twice as large. Ventricular premature beats usually followed deep negative T waves in ischemic myocardium, when "injury" currents were maximal. Earliest activity always occurred at the normal side of the ischemic border, and whenever Purkinje activity was recorded it preceded myocardial activity in both single premature beats and the initial beats of ventricular tachycardia (VT) or ventricular fibrillation (VF). For later beats of VT, circus movements with a diameter of 1-2 cm were responsible for continuation of the arrhythmia. Dimension and position of the reentrant circuit changed from beat to beat. In VF, fragmentation of wavefronts occurred, and multiple wavelets followed tortuous paths. Circus movements were seldom completed; when they were, their diameter was 0.5 cm. It is concluded that two mechanisms are responsible for the very early ischemic arrhythmias: one, a "focal" mechanism located at the normal side of the ischemic border, possibly induced by injury currents in normal Purkinje fibers and, two, macro- and micro-reentry in ischemic myocardium.

abstract = {Twenty-nine teams involving 61 analysts used the same dataset to address the same research question: whether soccer referees are more likely to give red cards to dark skin toned players than light skin toned players. Analytic approaches varied widely across teams, and estimated effect sizes ranged from 0.89 to 2.93 in odds ratio units, with a median of 1.31. Twenty teams (69{\%}) found a statistically significant positive effect and nine teams (31{\%}) observed a non- significant relationship. Crowdsourcing data analysis, a strategy by which numerous research teams are recruited to simultaneously investigate the same research question, makes transparent how variations in analytical choices affect results.},

abstract = {Background: Poor identification of electrical dyssynchrony is postulated to be a major factor contributing to the low success rate for cardiac resynchronization therapy. Objective: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the sensitivity of body surface mapping and electrocardiographic imaging (ECGi) to detect electrical dyssynchrony noninvasively. Methods: Langendorff-perfused pig hearts (n = 11) were suspended in a human torso-shaped tank, with left bundle branch block (LBBB) induced through ablation. Recordings were taken simultaneously from a 108-electrode epicardial sock and 128 electrodes embedded in the tank surface during sinus rhythm and ventricular pacing. Computed tomography provided electrode and heart positions in the tank. Epicardial unipolar electrograms were reconstructed from torso potentials using ECGi. Dyssynchrony markers from torso potentials (eg, QRS duration) or ECGi (total activation time, interventricular delay [D-LR], and intraventricular markers) were correlated with those recorded from the sock. Results: LBBB was induced (n = 8), and sock-derived activation maps demonstrated interventricular dyssynchrony (D-LR and total activation time) in all cases (P {\textless}.05) and intraventricular dyssynchrony for complete LBBB (P {\textless}.05) compared to normal sinus rhythm. Only D-LR returned to normal with biventricular pacing (P =.1). Torso markers increased with large degrees of dyssynchrony, and no reduction was seen during biventricular pacing (P {\textgreater}.05). Although ECGi-derived markers were significantly lower than recorded (P {\textless}.05), there was a significant strong linear relationship between ECGi and recorded values. ECGi correctly diagnosed electrical dyssynchrony and interventricular resynchronization in all cases. The latest site of activation was identified to 9.1 ± 0.6 mm by ECGi. Conclusion: ECGi reliably and accurately detects electrical dyssynchrony, resynchronization by biventricular pacing, and the site of latest activation, providing more information than do body surface potentials.},

abstract = {Patient-specific modeling of ventricular electrophysiology requires an interpolated reconstruction of the 3-dimensional (3D) geometry of the patient ventricles from the low-resolution (Lo-res) clinical images. The goal of this study was to implement a processing pipeline for obtaining the interpolated reconstruction, and thoroughly evaluate the efficacy of this pipeline in comparison with alternative methods. The pipeline implemented here involves contouring the epi- and endocardial boundaries in Lo-res images, interpolating the contours using the variational implicit functions method, and merging the interpolation results to obtain the ventricular reconstruction. Five alternative interpolation methods, namely linear, cubic spline, spherical harmonics, cylindrical harmonics, and shape-based interpolation were implemented for comparison. In the thorough evaluation of the processing pipeline, Hi-res magnetic resonance (MR), computed tomography (CT), and diffusion tensor (DT) MR images from numerous hearts were used. Reconstructions obtained from the Hi-res images were compared with the reconstructions computed by each of the interpolation methods from a sparse sample of the Hi-res contours, which mimicked Lo-res clinical images. Qualitative and quantitative comparison of these ventricular geometry reconstructions showed that the variational implicit functions approach performed better than others. Additionally, the outcomes of electrophysiological simulations (sinus rhythm activation maps and pseudo-ECGs) conducted using models based on the various reconstructions were compared. These electrophysiological simulations demonstrated that our implementation of the variational implicit functions-based method had the best accuracy.},

@article{Johnston2018a,
abstract = {Solving the inverse problem of electrocardiology via the Method of Fundamental Solutions has been proposed previously. The advantage of this approach is that it is a meshless method, so it is far easier to implement numerically than many other approaches. However, determining the heart surface potential distribution is still an ill-posed problem and thus requires some form of Tikhonov regularisation to obtain the required distributions. In this study, several methods for determining an “optimal” regularisation parameter are compared in the context of solving the inverse problem of electrocardiology via the Method of Fundamental Solutions. It is found that the Robust Generalised Cross-Validation method most often yields epicardial potential distributions with the least relative error when compared to the input distribution. The study also compares the inverse solutions obtained with the Method of Fundamental Solutions with those obtained in a previous study using the boundary element method. It is found that choosing the best solution methodology and regularisation parameter de- termination method depends on the particular scenario being considered.},
