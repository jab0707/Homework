                 angiographically proven coronary artery disease and 141
                 normal subjects. The test specificity was 93{\%} and
                 sensitivity 64{\%}, the latter being influenced by the
                 type of ST response: false-positive responses were rare
                 with depressed, downsloping STs (1 of 123, 1{\%}),
                 occurred more frequently with horizontal ST depression
                 (9 of 60, 15{\%}), and occurred commonly with slowly
                 upsloping STs (15 of 47, 32{\%}). Depressed downsloping
                 STs, ischemic changes appearing in the first 3 minutes
                 of exercise, and those persisting past 8 minutes in

                 attention to configuration, time of onset, and duration
                 of ischemic ST depression aids both in assessing the

                 risk for cardiovascular events but evidence supporting
                 this is scarce. We investigated the prognostic
                 implications of stable angina pectoris in relation to
                 the presence and degree of CAD with no obstructive CAD
                 in focus.Methods and resultsWe identified 11 223
                 patients referred for coronary angiography (CAG) in
                 1998–2009 with stable angina pectoris as indication
                 and 5705 participants from the Copenhagen City Heart
                 Study for comparison. Main outcome measures were major
                 adverse cardiovascular events (MACE), defined as
                 cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, stroke or
                 heart failure, and all-cause mortality. Significantly
                 more women (65{\%}) than men (32{\%}) had no
                 obstructive CAD (P{\textless} 0.001). In Cox's models
                 adjusted for age, body mass index, diabetes, smoking,
                 and use of lipid-lowering or antihypertensive
                 medication, hazard ratios (HRs) associated with no
                 obstructive CAD were similar in men and women. In the
                 pooled analysis, the risk of MACE increased with
                 increasing degrees of CAD with multivariable-adjusted
                 HRs of 1.52 (95{\%} confidence interval, 1.27–1.83)
                 for patients with normal coronary arteries and 1.85
                 (1.51–2.28) for patients with diffuse non-obstructive
                 CAD compared with the reference population. For
                 all-cause mortality, normal coronary arteries and

                 significant CAD. Methods and results: A broad search in
                 electronic databases until August 2017 was performed.
                 Studies on the aforementioned techniques in
                 {\textgreater}100 patients with stable CAD that
                 utilized either ICA or ICA with FFR measurement as
                 reference, were included. Study-level data was pooled
                 using a hierarchical bivariate random-effects model and
                 likelihood ratios were obtained for each technique. The
                 PTP ranges for each technique to rule-in or rule-out
                 significant CAD were defined. A total of 28 664
                 patients from 132 studies that used ICA as reference
                 and 4131 from 23 studies using FFR, were analysed.
                 Stress ECG can rule-in and rule-out anatomically
                 significant CAD only when PTP is {\textgreater}/=80{\%}
                 (76-83) and {\textless}/=19{\%} (15-25), respectively.
                 Coronary computed tomography angiography is able to
                 rule-in anatomic CAD at a PTP {\textgreater}/=58{\%}
                 (45-70) and rule-out at a PTP {\textless}/=80{\%}
                 (65-94). The corresponding PTP values for functionally
                 significant CAD were {\textgreater}/=75{\%} (67-83) and
                 {\textless}/=57{\%} (40-72) for CCTA, and
                 {\textgreater}/=71{\%} (59-81) and {\textless}/=27
                 (24-31) for ICA, demonstrating poorer performance of
                 anatomic imaging against FFR. In contrast, functional
                 imaging techniques (PET, stress CMR, and SPECT) are
                 able to rule-in functionally significant CAD when PTP
                 is {\textgreater}/=46-59{\%} and rule-out when PTP is

                 diagnostic modalities have different optimal
                 performance ranges for the detection of anatomically
                 and functionally significant CAD. Stress ECG appears to
                 have very limited diagnostic power. The selection of a
                 diagnostic technique for any given patient to rule-in
                 or rule-out CAD should be based on the optimal PTP

                 cal sources from body surface potential maps (BSPM) is
                 ill-posed. A standard Tikhonov regularization approach
                 to the problem produces a solution biased toward the
                 elec- trodes and thus to the left ventricular
                 epicardium, which limits its potential to reconstruct
                 endocardial sources. In this work we consider a
                 transmembrane voltages based in- verse problem of ECG
                 for the identification of extrasys- tole origins from
                 simulated BSPM. With use of a pair of heart wall
                 epicardial/endocardial extrasystoles and a pair of
                 septal ectopic foci we demonstrate the performance of
                 the inverse procedures while firstly solving the
                 problem for all nodes, then for epicardium and
                 endocardium sep- arately. Based on the observations and
                 the logic behind the gradient of sources we define
                 simple rules on how to classify an extrasystole under
                 consideration according to these 3 reconstructions.
                 Furthermore, when the amount of noise is known, we
                 propose a new method with two regu- larization

                 electrocardiographic imaging (ECGI) is the persistent
                 error in the associated forward problem observed in
                 experimental studies. One possible cause of this error
                 is insufficient representation of the cardiac sources;
                 cardiac source measurements often sample only the
                 ventricular epicardium, ignoring the endocardium and
                 the atria. We hypothesize that measurements that
                 completely cover the pericardial surface are required
                 for accurate forward solutions. In this study, we used
                 simulated and measured cardiac potentials to test the
                 effect of different levels of spatial source sampling
                 on the forward simulation. Not surprisingly, increasing
                 the source sampling over the atria reduced the average
                 error of the forward simulations, but some sampling
                 strategies were more effective than others. Uniform and
                 random distributions of samples across the atrial
                 surface were the most efficient strategies in terms of
                 lowest error with the fewest sampling locations,
                 whereas ``single direction'' strategies,
                 $\backslash$emph{\{}i.e.{\}}, adding to the
                 atrioventricular (AV) plane or atrial roof only, were
                 the least efficient. Complete sampling of the atria is
                 needed to eliminate errors from missing cardiac
                 sources, but adding a small number of electrodes on the
                 atria can significantly reduce these errors. Future
                 validation studies of the ECG forward simulations
                 should use a cardiac source sampling that takes these
                 considerations into account to provide well-validated
                 forward simulations, which will, in turn, improve
                 validation and understanding of ECGI.",

@Article{BLZ:Wan2016a,
  abstract =     "Background The majority of life-threatening
                 ventricular tachycardias (VTs) are sustained by
                 heterogeneous scar substrates with narrow strands of
                 surviving tissue. An effective treatment for
                 scar-related VT is to modify the underlying scar
                 substrate by catheter ablation. If activation sequence
                 and entrainment mapping can be performed during
                 sustained VT, the exit and isthmus of the circuit can
                 often be identified. However, with invasive catheter
                 mapping, only monomorphic VT that is hemodynamically
                 stable can be mapped in this manner. For the majority
                 of patients with poorly tolerated VTs or multiple VTs,
                 a close inspection of the re-entry circuit is not
                 possible. A noninvasive approach to fast mapping of
                 unstable VTs can potentially allow an improved
                 identification of critical ablation sites. Methods For
                 patients who underwent catheter ablation of
                 scar-related VT, CT scan was obtained prior to the
                 ablation procedure and 120-lead body-surface
                 electrocardiograms (ECGs) were acquired during induced
                 VTs. These data were used for noninvasive ECG imaging
                 to computationally reconstruct electrical potentials on
                 the epicardium and on the endocardium of both
                 ventricles. Activation time and phase maps of the VT
                 circuit were extracted from the reconstructed
                 electrograms. They were analyzed with respect to scar
                 substrate obtained from catheter mapping, as well as VT
                 exits confirmed through ablation sites that
                 successfully terminated the VT. Results The
                 reconstructed re-entry circuits correctly revealed both
                 epicardial and endocardial origins of activation,
                 consistent with locations of exit sites confirmed from
                 the ablation procedure. The temporal dynamics of the
                 re-entry circuits, particularly the slowing of
                 conduction as indicated by the crowding and zig-zag
                 conducting of the activation isochrones, collocated
                 well with scar substrate obtained by catheter voltage
                 maps. Furthermore, the results indicated that some
                 re-entry circuits involve both the epicardial and
                 endocardial layers, and can only be properly
                 interpreted by mapping both layers simultaneously.
                 Conclusions This study investigated the potential of
                 ECG-imaging for beat-to-beat mapping of unstable
                 reentrant circuits. It shows that simultaneous
                 epicardial and endocardial mapping may improve the
                 delineation of the 3D spatial construct of a re-entry
                 circuit and its exit. It also shows that the use of
                 phase mapping can reveal regions of slow conduction
                 that collocate well with suspected heterogeneous
                 regions within and around the scar.",

                 derived, to an excellent approximation, from the 12
                 standard leads or from 3 EASI leads (with 3 electrodes
                 at Frank's transverse level and 1 on the manubrium), by
                 using precalculated regression coefficients. By means
                 of bootstrap trials, we estimated the mean sensitivity
                 (SE) and the mean positive predictive value (PPV) with
                 which 3 “optimal” vessel-specific leads could
                 identify ischemia related to the LAD, RCA, and LCx
                 arteries, in the test set, as (SE/PPV) 94.7/92.8{\%},
                 78.7/80.9{\%}, and 81.5/80.9{\%}. A similar diagnostic
                 performance can be achieved by vessel-specific leads
                 derived from the 12-lead ECG (93.0/93.4{\%},
                 76.6/82.0{\%}, and 82.7/77.1{\%}) and, interestingly,
                 from the EASI lead system (97.8/88.4{\%},
                 78.0/80.2{\%}, and 76.8/83.2{\%}). Thus, although the
                 “optimal” bipolar leads for detecting ischemia
                 related to each of the 3 coronary arteries were found
                 to require sampling outside the 12-lead ECG, these
                 leads can be derived from the full set of 12 standard
                 leads or - for clinical monitoring applications - from
                 the EASI lead system by using fewer electrodes at
                 convenient locations. {\textcopyright} 2001 Churchill

  abstract =     "1. The contribution of the concentrating effect due to
                 shrinkage of the extracellular space (ECS) to cellular
                 K+ efflux on extracellular potassium ([K+]o)
                 accumulation in response to ischaemia was investigated
                 in an isolated, blood-perfused rabbit papillary muscle
                 preparation with a confined extracellular space. 2. The
                 ECS was quantified using either of two extracellular
                 markers, choline or tetramethyl ammonium (TMA), each
                 with specific ion-selective electrodes, as well as by
                 measurement of extracellular resistance (ro). [K+]o and
                 [Na+]o were also measured simultaneously using K(+)-
                 and Na(+)-selective electrodes. 3. During ischaemia,
                 [K+]o increased 3-fold from 4.2 +/- 0.1 to 12.6 +/- 1.0
                 mM at 10 min (n = 10) analogous to changes in the
                 ischaemic heart in vivo. The ECS decreased to 83.9 +/-
                 3.2{\%} of control measured using 1 mM choline
                 extracellularly (n = 9, P {\textless} 0.01) or to 85.7
                 +/- 0.7{\%} of control using 1 mM TMA (n = 6, P
                 {\textless} 0.01). Nearly identical decreases in ro
                 (84.1 +/- 2.4{\%}, n = 15, P {\textless} 0.01) occurred
                 simultaneously. 4. The small decrease in the ECS
                 contributed only 0.8-0.9 mM to the total increase in
                 [K+]o of 8.4 mM and had a minor effect on transmembrane
                 K+ flux. No significant differences between the
                 relative changes in [choline] and [Na+]o were observed.
                 This excluded a major transmembrane Na+ movement during
                 early ischaemia. 5. Bumetanide (10 mM), an inhibitor of
                 K(+)-Cl- cotransport, a process which is involved in
                 cell volume regulation consequent to osmotic cell
                 swelling, significantly attenuated the increase in
                 [K+]o after 6 min of ischaemia (8.3 +/- 0.6 mM, n = 5
                 vs. 10.3 +/- 0.4 mM in the control group, n = 6, P
                 {\textless} 0.05), whereas N-ethylmaleimide (1 mM), a
                 stimulator of this cotransporter, augmented [K+]o
                 accumulation (12.0 +/- 0.6 mM at 6 min, P {\textless}
                 0.05). 6. We conclude that during early myocardial
                 ischaemia, a major component of [K+]o accumulation is
                 not caused by diminution of ECS per se, but rather by
                 increased net K+ efflux due in part to K(+)-Cl
                 cotransport secondary to myocyte volume regulation.",

  abstract =     "Objetives. This study was designed to establish the
                 appropriate diagnostic criteria for positive dobutamine
                 electrocardiographic (ECG) stress test results and to
                 compare their accuracy with those of dobutamine
                 two-dimensional echocardiography and perfusion
                 scintigraphy. Background. Conventional criteria for
                 positive findings on ECG exercise testing may not be
                 appropriate for use with dobutamine ECG stress testing.
                 Methods. One hundred twenty-nine consecutive patients
                 with an interpretable ECG and without previous
                 myocardial infarction were prospectively studied at the
                 time of coronary arteriography. All completed a
                 standard dobutamine protocol (5 to 40 ??g/kg body
                 weight per min in 3-min dose increments) without side
                 effects. Significant coronary artery disease, defined
                 as {\textgreater}50{\%} lumen diameter stenosis of a
                 major epicardial coronary artery on coronary
                 angiography, was present in 83 patients. Empiric
                 receiver operating curves were generated for various
                 ECG criteria derived from computer-averaged signals.
                 Results. The best ECG criterion, with a sensitivity of
                 42{\%} and a specificity of 83{\%}, was an ST segment
                 shift, relative to baseline, of 0.5 mm 80 ms after the
                 J point. The sensitivity of this criterion was greater
                 than that of the conventional criterion of 1-mm ST
                 segment depression 60 (23{\%}) or 80 (18{\%}) ms after
                 the J point, was comparable to that of chest pain
                 occurring during the test (44{\%}, p = NS) but remained
                 inferior to the sensitivities of technetium99m methoxyl
                 isobutyl isonitrile (mibi) perfusion (76{\%}) or stress
                 echocardiography (76{\%}, p {\textless} 0.001, for
                 both). The specificity of this criterion was not
                 significantly different from that of technetium-99m
                 mibi perfusion tomography (65{\%}) or stress
                 echocardiography (89{\%}) but was superior to that of
                 chest pain (59{\%}, p {\textless} 0.025). Conclusions.
                 We conclude that this new criterion for dobutamine
                 electrocardiography is specific but that an imaging
                 technique is still required to accurately predict
                 coronary artery disease. ?? 1994.",

  abstract =     "Background. To overcome the relatively low accuracy of
                 exercise stress testing (EST) in detecting coronary
                 artery disease (CAD), both echocardiography and
                 perfusion scintigraphy have been evaluated in
                 conjunction with pharmacologic stress, but there is
                 still uncertainty of the relative value of these tests
                 as possible first-line examinations for suspected CAD.
                 This study evaluated the accuracy of EST, dipyridamole
                 and dobutamine stress echocardiography (DIP-ECHO,
                 DOB-ECHO), and dipyridamole and dobutamine technetium
                 99m sestamibi tomography (DIP-MIBI, DOB-MIBI) for the
                 detection of CAD in patients evaluated for the first
                 time because of chest pain. Methods and results. Sixty
                 patients underwent EST, DIP-ECHO, DOB-ECHO, DIP-MIBI,
                 and DOB-MIBI. Echocardiographic images were acquired
                 simultaneously with sestamibi injections, and the
                 scintigraphic images were collected 1 hour later.
                 Coronary angiography was performed within 15 days. Out
                 of 33 patients with significant ( {\textgreater}
                 70{\%}) coronary stenoses, 19 (58{\%}) were correctly
                 identified by EST, 18 (55{\%}) by DIP-ECHO, 20 (61{\%})
                 by DOB-ECHO, 32 (97{\%}) by DIP-MIBI, and 30 (91{\%})
                 by DOB-MIBI (p {\textless} 0.005 for MIBI vs EST and
                 ECHO). The specificity of EST was 67{\%} (p {\textless}
                 0.05 vs ECHO and MIBI), 96{\%}, 96{\%}, 89{\%}, and
                 81{\%}, respectively. Of the 62 stenotic coronary
                 arteries, 20 (32{\%}) were correctly identified by
                 DIP-ECHO, 24 (39{\%}) by DOB-ECHO, 48 (77{\%}) by
                 DIP-MIBI, and 45 (73{\%}) by DOB-MIBI. The sensitivity
                 of the imaging techniques in predicting the presence of
                 multivessel disease was 14{\%} and 29{\%} for DIP and
                 DOB-ECHO compared with 48{\%} and 57{\%} for DIP and
                 DOB-MIBI. Conclusions. Our results confirm the limited
                 reliability of EST in detecting CAD and the good
                 diagnostic value of DIP and DOB-MIBI. Conversely, the
                 lower sensitivity and the poorer capability to
                 recognize multivessel CAD do not support the role of
                 either DIP or DOB-ECHO as first-line examination for
                 suspected CAD.",

  abstract =     "Research has indicated that atrial fibrillation (AF)
                 ablation failure is related to the presence of atrial
                 fibrosis. However it remains unclear whether this
                 information can be successfully used in predicting the
                 optimal ablation targets for AF termination. We aimed
                 to provide a proof-of-concept that patient-specific
                 virtual electrophysiological study that combines i)
                 atrial structure and fibrosis distribution from
                 clinical MRI and ii) modeling of atrial
                 electrophysiology, could be used to predict: (1) how
                 fibrosis distribution determines the locations from
                 which paced beats degrade into AF; (2) the dynamic
                 behavior of persistent AF rotors; and (3) the optimal
                 ablation targets in each patient. Four MRI-based
                 patient-specific models of fibrotic left atria were
                 generated, ranging in fibrosis amount. Virtual
                 electrophysiological studies were performed in these
                 models, and where AF was inducible, the dynamics of AF
                 were used to determine the ablation locations that
                 render AF non-inducible. In 2 of the 4 models
                 patient-specific models AF was induced; in these models
                 the distance between a given pacing location and the
                 closest fibrotic region determined whether AF was
                 inducible from that particular location, with only the
                 mid-range distances resulting in arrhythmia. Phase
                 singularities of persistent rotors were found to move
                 within restricted regions of tissue, which were
                 independent of the pacing location from which AF was
                 induced. Electrophysiological sensitivity analysis
                 demonstrated that these regions changed little with
                 variations in electrophysiological parameters.
                 Patient-specific distribution of fibrosis was thus
                 found to be a critical component of AF initiation and
                 maintenance. When the restricted regions encompassing
                 the meander of the persistent phase singularities were
                 modeled as ablation lesions, AF could no longer be
                 induced. The study demonstrates that a patient-specific
                 modeling approach to identify non-invasively AF
                 ablation targets prior to the clinical procedure is
                 feasible.",

                 distributions were chosen because they can be
                 unambiguously measured, are useful in understanding the
                 shapes of wave forms at many specific sites, and
                 provide a direct measure of repolarization. Unipolar
                 wave forms were recorded from intramural and epicardial
                 electrodes and converted into potential distributions.
                 Well-known shapes of wave forms recorded at the inner
                 and outer layers of the ventricles as well as
                 peak-to-peak voltages were shown by the potential
                 distributions to be determined primarily by
                 superposition effects of distant excitation waves.
                 These effects were most prominent before epicardial
                 breakthrough and then receded during the last half of
                 the QRS complex. However, the potential distributions
                 became more complex as excitation waves merged,
                 collided, and terminated. During terminal
                 depolarization, there were scattered positive
                 repolarization potentials intramurally. Normal
                 repolarization was characterized by positive potentials
                 over the ventricular epicardium while there were
                 changes intramurally and on the atrium. Throughout the
                 T wave, there was a predominant transmural
                 unidirectional gradient with the inner wall being more
                 negative than the outer wall. This finding confirms
                 that the sequence of repolarization is from the
                 epicardium to the endocardium with the middle layers
                 having an intermediate time.",

                 the accuracy of noninvasive reconstructions of
                 epicardial potentials, electrograms, activation and
                 recovery isochrones, and beat origins by simultaneously
                 performing electrocardiographic imaging (ECGI) and
                 invasive epicardial electrography in intact animals.
                 Background Noninvasive imaging of electrical potentials
                 at the epicardium, known as ECGI, is increasingly
                 applied in patients to assess normal and abnormal
                 cardiac electrical activity. Methods Body-surface
                 potentials and epicardial potentials were recorded in
                 normal anesthetized dogs. Computed tomography scanning
                 provided a torso-heart geometry that was used to
                 reconstruct epicardial potentials from body-surface
                 potentials. Results Electrogram reconstructions
                 attained a moderate accuracy compared with epicardial
                 recordings (median correlation coefficient: 0.71), but
                 with considerable variation (interquartile range: 0.36
                 to 0.86). This variation could be explained by a
                 spatial mismatch (overall resolution was {\textless}20

                 0.73), and the origin of paced beats (median error: 10
                 mm; interquartile range: 7 to 17 mm) was achieved by a
                 spatiotemporal approach that incorporates the
                 characteristics of the respective electrogram and
                 neighboring electrograms. Reconstruction of beats from
                 repeated single-site pacing showed a stable
                 localization of origin. Cardiac motion, currently
                 ignored in ECGI, correlates negatively with
                 reconstruction accuracy. Conclusions ECGI shows a
                 decent median accuracy, but variability in electrogram
                 reconstruction can be sizable. At present, therefore,
                 clinical interpretations of ECGI should not be made on
                 the basis of single electrograms only. Incorporating
                 local spatiotemporal characteristics allows for
                 accurate reconstruction of epicardial activation and
                 recovery patterns, and beat origin localization to a
                 10-mm precision. Even more reliable interpretations are
                 expected when the influences of cardiac motion are
                 accounted for in ECGI.",
