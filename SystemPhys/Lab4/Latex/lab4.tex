\section{Introduction}
\par{}
Simulation based on models for the electrical activity of the heart are becoming a more and more common approach for the study and understanding of the way in which electrical potentials propagate from the heart to the torso surface as well as for the study of the underlying cardiac electro-physiology.[|<cite brett and such>] From this research effort, investigative tools such as ECGSIM have been developed to better interrogate the relationships between simulated cardiac action potentials and the resultant cardiac and torso electrical activity. In this lab our goal was to utilize ECGSIM to investigate the relationship between the characteristics of the heart such as the simulated action potentials on the heart surface and the resultant electrograms as measured on the heart and torso surface.
