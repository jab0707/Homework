\title{Troponin-C }

\maketitle

\section{Introduction}
Troponin C is a protein found in skeletan and cardiac muslce that helps control the initiation of contraction of the muscle fiber. Troponin C makes up a regulatory complex of troponin proteins (troponin 1, C and L) which all acto to modulate the binding of tropomyosin to actin filaments in the muscle. The function of the troponin complex, and by extenion the function of troponin c, is critical to the proper timing, strength, and frequency of muscle contraction in both skeletal and cardiac muscle. Troponin is also used as a biochemical marker of heart health during potential instances of acute cardiac damage such as a myocardial infarction, as it is released into the blood when cardiomyocytes are damaged.
